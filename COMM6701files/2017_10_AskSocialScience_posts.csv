By that I mean not the practice of using TWs per se but its resulting outcry and backlash. For a lot of subject matters, it seems to be a common occurence that someone might say something that *happens* to coincide with some grand public narratives (whether it reflects the ""whiny youngster""-trope or SJW-craze or, anything really that happens to be ""in vogue"", regardless of viability), and it is picked up by the media and thrown into the great horror show that has become public discourse.

Has anyone written or done research about this kind of thing? What are the factors that determine these processes? I could for sure speculate that the technological complexity of communication leads to such an information glut that any narrative can be supported with rich anecdotal reports. I could also speculate about the market model of mainstream media, which leads to a competitive media environment where conflict-based subject matter results in greater ad revenue and might as well lead to the construction of niche populations. But what determines what sticks? 

Is it so that public discourse in effect gets reified in the general population, effectively being ""created"" by the media (or the competitive pressures that they are subordinated to)? An example of this is recent and from my home country, where a prominent politician wore a Native American costume for a party. This lead to a shitstorm in mainstream media, with highly conflict-based material, and a lot of opinion pieces on how we are easily offended and importing an American outrage culture. However, any nuanced debate was completely impossible, and it also served to strengthen that politician's public appeal (it seemed to have been well-planned based on statements from the party). But, since people naturally assume the newspaper to involve debates (and not highly selected material from a news desk), they are almost forced to take sides, and paradoxically, this constructed outrage seems to lead to *actual* outrage, because people can't believe that people are outraged.

So, does anyone know anything about any work done on what influences public debate/discourse and how it influences us. Any other associations regarding my rambling would also be welcome.

Our contemporary western conception of ""age"" is defined by the number of times the Earth has revolved around the Sun since the moment of our birth.

However, since this concept of age is heliocentric, it stands to reason that before this scientific model we would have measured aging differently.

And further, I don't want to simply assume that the entire world, including indigenous peoples who are not in constant communication with the west and their surrounding major civilizations share the same exact definition of aging as ours.

I always think of this trend in terms of two quotes from Kevin Smith films:

_Mallrats_ (1995)

""And I use that to fuck them some place fairly uncomfortable.""

[""What, like the back of a Volkswagen?""] 

""No. Like someplace girls dread.""

_Clerks 2_ (2006)

Becky: [to Dante] ""Sometimes, in the heat of the moment, it's forgivable to go ass to mouth.""

This suggests that (at least to Kevin Smith), the social attitude towards anal sex has undergone a complete about-face in the intervening 11 years.

I have no personal experience of what hetero sex culture was like prior to 2000. I would expect that the AIDS epidemic caused a decline in the amount of heterosexual anal sex, but I don't know if it was even popular beforehand.

Google Trends only goes back to 2004 and shows a huge spike in interest in 2006-2007 [[link]] (https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=anal%20sex), but after that interest falls to below-2006 levels and remains more or less stable.

According to [this 2010 article] (http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_nature/2010/10/the_ass_man_cometh.html) from Slate,
&gt;  In 1992, 16 percent of women aged 18-24 said they'd tried anal sex. Now 20 percent of women aged 18-19 say they've done it, and by ages 20-24, the number is 40 percent. In 1992, the highest percentage of women in any age group who admitted to anal sex was 33. In 2002, it was 35. Now it's 46.

The article offers the possible explanation that the women participating in anal sex are more sexually fulfilled and hence more likely to agree to anal as a favour to their partner, essentially. I'm not sure if this is true but even if it is, it doesn't completely answer my question: What factors in the cultural zeitgeist contributed to people wanting anal sex in the first place?",,78mj1k,,0,,false,1510476846,true,nsfw,t5_2sml9,false,,,false,true,,/r/AskSocialScience/comments/78mj1k/nsfwish_has_the_popularity_of_anal_sex_among/,,,,,

Searches for gay porn have been shown to be more prevalent in cultures that hold more homophobic beliefs (the Middle East and American South, for example). It seems fairly intuitive that fetishes are often born out of cultural taboo, restriction and stigma.

Without getting too pseudo-Freudian about it, I always thought Japan's unusual fetishes, particularly around hyper-violence was an outlet for the Japanese stigma on male aggressiveness (I have no explanation for Octopus porn) and Germany's unusual penchant for scat porn was an outlet for German culture's value of 'Ordnung' (orderliness, cleanliness, etc.), an anal expulsive response to an anal retentive society (maybe).

I did some deep sociological research browsing the top categories of Pornhub and am convinced the western world's cultural fetish is jailbait...for better of worse. The top category is ""teens"" and it filled with 18-year-old-girls obviously made to look younger, wearing school girl uniforms, braces sucking on suckers and all the general Lolita-esque semiotics you'd expect.

I now live in New Orleans, a few hours from Angola Prison.

I can't.)

Each year they have a rodeo there that prisoners participate in - they do the rodeo events and many sell art/handmade goods. It's a bunch of white, trump supporting Louisianans watching primarily back men risk life and limb for a few bucks (gladiators much?).

From my description I obviously wouldn't go for the entertainment of it, but here's the issue: my wife wants to go to see this thing that we kind of can't believe actually happens. Many other people have said that the inmates love this event, that they work all year preparing for it, and work for years to get trusted access to be able to interact with community members. The money mostly goes to them (80% directly to them from purchases) and to resources they use (libraries etc) - and the hundreds of inmates that participate obviously see it as better than the alternatives.

That said, I sort of feel that it's disaster tourism - that it's riding a bus through the lower 9 after Katrina, or visiting one of those segregated restaurants in the 60's (not to protest, but just to have a sandwich at the lunch counter).

Am I overthinking this or inflating my own sense of importance here? Is the Angola Rodeo a net positive, or is my attendance just helping perpetuate a disaster of a system?

I am a junior at a liberal arts college taking an introductory economics course that teaches different schools of thought in economics. The class and the professor have a pretty heavy-handed bias against neoclassical economics/mainstream economics. In the class, we are being taught that historically markets and barter didn't exist before the ""advent"" of capitalism, which was brought about by the reformation and the enclosure movements in Europe. Instead, it argues that pre-capitalist economic systems evolved from a communitarian society to a command/feudal society to the market-based economic system we have today. Is there any evidence for this kind of thinking and what is mainstream economics' response to this sort of historical analysis?

Or traffic fatalities.  Or deaths from natural disaster.

*""The Oriental doesn't put the same high price on life as does a Westerner. Life is plentiful. Life is cheap in the Orient.""*

General William Westmoreland in the Oscar-winning 1974 Vietnam documentary ""Hearts and Minds."" 

Westmoreland's statement is political incorrect and arguably patently insulting.  But the underlying sentiment appears to have some truth, based on patterns of reporting in the media (eastern vs. western) and comments of political leaders.

Virtually ever death of a U.S. soldier is highly publicized.   Of course, military deaths are a special category:  Reaction is in part political posturing over a perceived inappropriate handling of military affairs (both Bengazi and Niger).   Second, it is a patriotic reminder to all citizens of yet another America who paid *the ultimate sacrifice.*  

But there seems to be more than this here:  In the U.S. public anguish about unexpected deaths seems to be a collective catharsis, or at least a rite.  It is regularly expressed, sometimes nationwide, for just a few deaths, which could consist of anything from traffic fatalities to natural disaster.

(I exclude mass shootings for two reasons:  1) They are virtually nonexistent in Asian cultures.  2) They are preventable.  Anguish can lead to actions to prevent reoccurrence.  Traffic accidents and natural disaster *[and losing soldiers in combat, IMO]* are less preventable and therefore are logically met with some equanimity).

Some years back a commentator less provocative than Westmoreland observed that the heavily populated Asian nations regularly suffer the deaths of thousands in earthquakes, floods, and other natural disasters.  For this reason, he observed, these nations did not adopt the practice of becoming overemotional about small numbers of humans deaths.  Part of everyday life, if you will.....

Any truth to these comments?

Several women reacted to a poem in a certain way. I didn't think it was an appropriate reaction, and argued that they were interpreting the poem in a way I didn't think was intended / correct.

I argued that the individual's experience / opinion doesn't have particular value when discussing the texts meaning, and especially it doesn't allow the individual to impose their ideas on someone else, even if the individual is female which would not allow the male to understand the female experience.

Examples of social institutions include *family, religion, education, economy, and government*.

Later in college, I was introduced to the concept of a social construct. As far as I know, a **social construct** is *an idea, mechanism, or phenomenon that was created by society and exists solely in the confines of a society*. Examples of social constructs include *money* (which is connected to economy), *citizenship* (which is connected to government), and *marriage* (which is connected to family). I am confused on how to make sense of these two terms. Can someone please verify that my definitions are correct?

Also are all social institutions also social constructs? If so, is the reverse (inverse) true? (All social constructs are also social institutions)",,766v7s,,0,,false,1510431974,false,self,t5_2sml9,false,,,false,true,,/r/AskSocialScience/comments/766v7s/are_all_social_institutions_also_social/,,,,,

He said that was because ""postmodernism has infected academia and said that there's no objective basis for morality and we shouldn't actively criticize inferior cultural practices and accept human rights violations to women in the Muslim world while feminists complain about imaginary oppression...etc.""

If I were to study it using more qualitative methods, I would be using something like process tracing, I guess. But Im having a hard time to see how it could be formed.

I am trying to find the right materials for a study I am setting up with two other students. We want to prime the concept of  a global citizen and I am struggling to find the right way to do it. The Sumerian warrior story is used in many researches to prime individualistic/collectivistic values but I don't know if it can be changed to prime a complex concept like global citizen. A scrambled word task would be nice because it is easy to implement but the effect size seems to be pretty small.
I would really appreciate it if someone would help me figure thus out.

Such arguments say, in uniformly bullish tones, that, contrary to social psychology dogma, the literature repeatedly confirms that people's ""stereotypes"" are ""accurate"", and that this has been repeatedly confirmed with a far higher degree of reproducibility and/or to a far higher probabilistic standard than any contrary research, not to mention pretty much any other research in social psychology.

So my question is: what on Earth are they talking about? None of the things I've read have anything remotely specific to say about what is meant by ""stereotype"", which is an extremely broad term, nor about how the literature gets such impressive results. This seems natural given the activist nature of the articles I've seen discussed, which are geared most of all to pushing what they see as neglected research out into the open against a tide of unfair scepticism, but it's incredibly frustrating, notwithstanding that at least one of the references I've seen to this has been in pseudo-liberal fake science outlet *Quillette*.

Who can help me out? How is ""stereotype"" being used here? What is it that makes such a thing as a stereotype ""accurate""? Does the literature really back the generality of this claim? For example: lurking in the background of all of this is ""racial"" stereotyping, does the literature *really* demonstrate that racial stereotypes in the workplace are generally accurate (as I've seen implied once, and thankfully only once)?
