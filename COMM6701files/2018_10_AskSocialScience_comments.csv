"&gt; what's the best fiction book you can name if I want to read it just for it's social science commentary?

[Joan D. Vinge](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/32279.Joan_D_Vinge) is a science fiction author with a degree in anthropology. I quite liked her Snow Queen series, which is a lot like Dune. If you are looking mostly for social commentary in science fiction form, [The Outcasts of Heaven Belt](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1442619.Outcasts_of_Heaven_Belt) is probably closer. It is about culture clash between people from two vastly different societies, and what cultural practises they used to get around the problems posed by the landscape. 

I have heard great things about [Ursula K. Le Guin's](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/874602.Ursula_K_Le_Guin) books and how she constructed fictional political systems and societies, but I have not personally read any of them.",NA,FALSE,NA,"Hatherence",NA,NA,1540255482,"t5_2sml9","t3_9qb1sz","t3_9qb1sz",2,1541353518,0,0,"e89q2es","AskSocialScience",NA,NA,NA

"If Marx intended workers to pay a wage to someone who fills an essential role, then some surplus value would be going to the capitalist in this example:

&gt;Let us now consider the total value of the product, the 10 lbs. of yarn. Two and a half days’ labour has been embodied in it, of which two days were contained in the cotton and in the substance of the spindle worn away, and half a day was absorbed during the process of spinning. This two and a half days’ labour is also represented by a piece of gold of the value of fifteen shillings. Hence, fifteen shillings is an adequate price for the 10 lbs. of yarn, or the price of one pound is eighteenpence.

&gt;Our capitalist stares in astonishment. The value of the product is exactly equal to the value of the capital advanced. The value so advanced has not expanded, no surplus-value has been created, and consequently money has not been converted into capital. The price of the yarn is fifteen shillings, and fifteen shillings were spent in the open market upon the constituent elements of the product, or, what amounts to the same thing, upon the factors of the labour-process; ten shillings were paid for the cotton, two shillings for the substance of the spindle worn away, and three shillings for the labour-power. The swollen value of the yarn is of no avail, for it is merely the sum of the values formerly existing in the cotton, the spindle, and the labour-power: out of such a simple addition of existing values, no surplus-value can possibly arise. [13] These separate values are now all concentrated in one thing; but so they were also in the sum of fifteen shillings, before it was split up into three parts, by the purchase of the commodities.

"Because returns don’t matter to institutional investors nearly as much as risk. If you have a strategy that returns 5% per year with only 1% volatility, that’s a significantly better risk/return profile than the S&amp;P 500, which returns roughly 8% per year with about 14% volatility historically.

"I have read Marx. Indeed, I'm the only person in this long thread who has actually quoted Marx. I will quote again exactly the same bit that I quoted elsewhere.

&gt; We could show, from another point of view, how not only the supply, but also the demand, is determined by the cost of production. But this would lead us too far away from our subject.
&gt;
&gt; We have just seen how the fluctuation of supply and demand always bring the price of a commodity back to its cost of production. The actual price of a commodity, indeed, stands always above or below the cost of production; but the rise and fall reciprocally balance each other, so that, within a certain period of time, if the ebbs and flows of the industry are reckoned up together, the commodities will be exchanged for one another in accordance with their cost of production. Their price is thus determined by their cost of production.
&gt;
&gt; ...
&gt; The determination of price by cost of production is tantamount to the determination of price by the labor-time requisite to the production of a commodity, for the cost of production consists, first of raw materials and wear and tear of tools, etc., i.e., of industrial products whose production has cost a certain number of work-days, which therefore represent a certain amount of labor-time, and, secondly, of direct labor, which is also measured by its duration.

You can find publications and reports based on these data in the corresponding pages. You can also check the [International Self-Report Delinquency Survey,](https://web.northeastern.edu/isrd/) in which the USA also participates.

Regarding how pertinent the numbers of the BJS 1980-2008 report is today, there are two answers. For absolute numbers and trends, they are only valid for the years they were collected for (trends can change, especially in the short term). The information given by relative numbers (e.g. percentages) should still be, generally speaking, correct - such that young people are more likely to be either victim or offender, likewise for males.

If you are interested in studies, there are many, thus I will avoid giving a list. It depends on what you are interested on. Long term trends? Specific risk factors for victimization and offending? For specific topics such as gender or ethnicity? Etc.

"(Sorry, one more reply because my actual reply was too long for a single post.)

&gt;I think that there are benefits to having theories defined enough for us to know what to expect under specific circumstances. These things are iterative and likely intersectional so I am sure there will be times that we need to revise even the most well defined of theories.

I don't see much sociocultural anthropology trying to predict behavior. It's descriptive and explanatory of things that have already happened. I can see how having predictive models is useful for other disciplines, but I think this is again where we get into needing to be specific about critiques of problems in specific disciplines or areas of work.

I also think that revision (or abandonment) of well-defined theories is always already going on, isn't it?

Anthropology is obsessed with theory, and I've long pushed back against what I see as some of the excesses of anthropological navel-gazing. I just don't think the problem is ""postmodernism"" or ""grievance studies"" or ""SJWs"" or whatever other things from ""The Left"" they blame, but a result of anthropological history. I've also spent a lot of time in gender studies classrooms at the graduate level and read a lot of gender studies theory (and I do think there is some batshit stuff out there, but that's not unique to gender studies). I think painting broad pictures of entire fields of study based on a few cherry-picked ""absurd"" theoretical approaches is unwarranted. There's a lot of really great work coming out of gender studies, a huge interdisciplinary field.

Anyway, I think we are mostly in agreement that there are areas for improvement, even if we disagree (slightly?) about what is actually shedding light on those areas and who is engaging in good-faith efforts to make those improvements. I think conversations like ours are great--and, while this specific conversation was spawned from this ""hoax,"" I've been having these kinds of conversations for years and actively working myself to try to improve peer review and my own field of study as best I can.

OP was asking about falsifiability and verifiability of the specific hypothesis of cultural hegemony as described by Gramsci.

Sure, but again it's not really about learning the language. It's about learning a handful (no pun intended) of symbols from that language, but none of the underlying structure or nuance.

And by analogy the hearing parents who teach their kids a few rudimentary signs are doing with an imperfect accent and one that, if the kid ever continued on learning whichever signed language the signs are from, would eventually surely adjust, but if they don't continue then that won't happen, and the French student analogy comes back into play real quick.

Not arguing with you, for the record. Definitely not looking for an internet fight. But these are distinctions that matter. Your initial correction of my original answer doesn't really cut the mustard when it comes down to it; ASL/Auslan/BSL are not easier to learn, _in the context of really learning a language_. It reminds me of a friend who was adamant her first language was Spanish, because she had a Spanish speaking nanny when she was an infant, never mind that the handful of words she would have learned weren't at all retained and none of the syntax came with it. I don't think anyone else would really agree that she had ""learned Spanish"" at that point in any meaningful way.

Language is crazy complex and there's a reason it takes kids literal years to become passable in their first one.

"Philosophical theories are the older theories that every layman has heard about.

Psychoanalysis

Humanistic approach

The new field of nurture-nature theories are based on scientific results and not old philosophy concepts. So it's: experiment shows A therefore we shall think A is probably real.

Cognitive psychology

Then came:

Biological psychology

And now we have the newest scientific foundations in:

Evolutionary psychology

After this we have not gotten a new perspective.

-------------

The new more science focused fields of psychology are not really epistemologies as much as they are just fields you can study in in a way. They have a philosophical foundation but it's basically: whatever the studies show us. The foundation is constantly adapted to the current science. And you don't belong in one field anymore. You must use all fields to understand psychology.

First of all, be careful with the [ecological fallacy](https://socialresearchmethods.net/kb/fallacy.php). Even if I were to provide some studies demonstrating, for example, that women tend to promote a more inclusive corporate culture, it does not mean that the individuals you will interview fit the mold.

Secondly and related to the above, members of a minority group can perpetuate the dominant culture and internalize biases and prejudices. A notorious example is the [Queen Bee phenomenon](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1048984315001551). This kind of phenomena is not limited to women, it is also the case of other minorities (such as Black people) who, after achieving social mobility, distance themselves from their previous, lower-status group, and embrace the values of the higher status groups, and legitimize the status quo, as explained by [social identity theory](https://student.cc.uoc.gr/uploadFiles/%CE%92310/Tajfel%20&amp;%20Turner%2086_SIT_xs.pdf).

"I'm speaking strictly of Seoul Korean, since that's what I'm most familiar with, but it may also be occurring elsewhere. In Seoul at least we're a few decades into its development.

There are two things at play. One is that there is a natural phonetic link between pitch and articulatory features. For example a voiced obstruent will be slightly lower in pitch than a voiceless counterpart. This is often imperceptible, but can become a triggering feature for a split between high and low pitches. This happened in Thai and Chinese languages, and is a well-attested shift. In Seoul Korean, the so-called tense phonemes such as ㅃ tend to be realised not as actually more tense or anything like that, but simply with a higher pitch. 

However, and this is the second of the two things I said were at play, native speakers are basically oblivious to this and the way that people talk about their own language is still very much that they are ""tense"" and unique to Korean. However, at least for Seoul Korean, it's really pitch that makes them different.

There is a lot of good work by native Korean speakers being published on tonogenesis in Korean, including a number of doctoral theses in the past few years. It's very much a thing, supported by experimental evidence, and actually puts to rest a long-standing problem of the way ""tense"" stops were described as basically counter to the rest of what we know about how voiceless stops can be distinguished in language.

If you haven't heard of it it's because as a speaker, in Korea, it would never come up described that way, because the more traditional narrative is a three-way split between voiceless onsets, but one which isn't really experimentally verifiable.

"Hey, 
I understand your concern for the lack of scientific method and empirical evidence. I suggest you raise this issue to your friend and hear his/her justification on it because I, too am a poli sci major and currently writing my thesis without empirical evidence. 

There are many forms of research that can be conduct without empirical evidence in poli sci. Usually, discourse papers do not include empirical evidence but it also depends on the length of the paper and the amount of time/resources that person has. Acquiring empirical evidence in social science realm is very difficult. You need A LOT of money to conduct empirical research: i.e surveys, or an ethnographer on site. It’s difficult to measure culture, power, and values. If you do not have the resources or time to conduct an empirical research you just have to find other works that have conducted these research with evidence provided and use it as a lit review. 

Unlike science, social science can’t be “found” in a lab. We usually have to do field study and collecting those data take up money and time. We find other kinds of evidence available and analyze it. For example, my paper is about education effects on citizens thought and behaviour. How would I be able to conduct that empirical research as a college student? To actually have empirical evidence I will either have to do a survey for that population or study a generation as they develop through the education and see how the generation turn out. So, I gather syllabus from schools- analyze the pattern to see the underlying motifs and values these schools are trying to produce. Then I gather evidence of social media interaction from that population to show the reflection of their behaviour/thoughts. Of course, there is no absolute determine of correlation between the two but this is the best I could do as a college student doing a thesis for one semester.

"Soccer, cinema, otaku...Correct me if I am mistaken, but when you distinguish ""traditional conservative"" aspects of culture and their counterpart, are you actually asking about knowledge or interest for something like [pop culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture), versus something like [high culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_culture)?

And I think a second level of your question is about transient culture versus what is commonly associated with what is learned about history and art at school, and what is commonly associated with these two subjects in general (landmark moments such as development of countries, development of institutions and instruments such as guilds and printing, wars, classic paintings, etc.).

Do tell me if I have managed to identify the two key elements of your thought.  You have written a lot, and it's a bit unstructured, so it is not too obvious at which angle to approach the question.

&amp;#x200B;

I would suggest that one part of your question is for historians to answer (maybe r/AskHistorians?) about how their field is defined and what are the mainstream focuses and why. As a general answer, nobody can be an expert of everything, but there are definitely scholars of pop culture specifically, and other niches. I would suggest that knowing about World War II or about Thatcher's policies and their causes and effects has more ""general interest"" than Otaku subculture, which is niche in of itself, and thus a more specific interest. Likewise, cinema and sports would respectively be the interest of whoever is interested in the history of cinema and the history of sports, rather than ""history"" as generally understood. Still, franchises such as Horrible Histories did take the time to touch upon, say, the [history of sports](https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2012/29/horrible_histories), which however gives an example of how it's a ""side"" thing.

There is also the issue of availability of information. Putin's actions as President of the Russian Federation have international impact and attract international interest by mass media, thus are easier to learn about (even passively), while learning what junk food Russians like requires digging, going to Russia to study the people, probably knowing Russian too.

For a more critical approach, there is the fact that people [distinguish higher quality culture (high culture) and lowbrow culture.](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeroen_Vermunt/publication/254841291_Classifications_under_discussion_Latent_class_analysis_of_time_budget_dat_on_reading_behavior/links/54a2c4480cf267bdb90426be.pdf) Fine arts, that is for the aristocracy or the elite, while popular culture is for those of lower status.

"You have a very well thought out response to this.  Personally I do think the social sciences has its place, and it is important to see how we might be able to help those who are disenfranchized within society, but I do think that these topics can get taken too far.

As a gay man, when reading gay publications over and over again, I constantly see people misuse words like ""toxic masculinity"" and ""social construct"" to try and describe gay men's sexuality - in the sense that society has socially constructed gay men to find toxic masculinity attractive over femininity, and it is wrong.

This article is a good example.

It just baffles my mind how a school of thought, and a publication like Slate, could write an article criticizing gay men for their sexuality just because it is rifled with the ""right"" buzzwords, like toxic masculinity and social construct.  I have yet to see any kind of scientific argument to prove their case, or even support it, and when I posted the question here on this sub it seemed like an overwhelming argument against using the terms to invalidate a persons sexuality, yet here we are - article after article publishing such nonsense.

- Most are not billionaires.  Many have a household income at or below the median household income of 59k/year.  Only 5% are in the top bracket of 500k+ per year.  Over half of landlords work a day job, and only 17% have landlording as their primary source of income.
- 60% only own a single rental property, 90% own five or less.
- Most rental properties were purchased for less than $250,000.

"You say that someone investing into an activity which increases production and a landlord investing in real estate to rent out are essentially the same. I take it that landlords are somehow improving the property over time or otherwise generating something of value then? What is it? You take for granted that people need to be paid in order to not spend everything they have - why? There is no indication that people spend everything anyway.

You claim that ""the effect the investment has"" is just another type of roi, but there is a pretty big difference between the two. It's the difference between capital as in money and capital as in machines and land and technology and things of value. It's the same problem that the story on comparative advantage in international trade has: you cannot change machines into other Machines the same way you can switch around wealth - a production process needs to happen, and trades require buyers. See for example the rust belt in the US, or any other old industries. Why don't they just switch to producing something else? Because money and the means of production are not the same thing.

Also, if there is no return on capital *the State will still have all the capital they can possibly need*. Moreover, consider that the idea that everybody always consumes to the max all the time is kind of bogus when the amount of invested capital in Western societies is between 40 and 60% of total wealth. Savings exist. Capital will still exist because money has intrinsic value as insurance, and because the state can run a deficit.

"&gt; You can reliably repeat a chemistry or physics experiment, because the behaviours of the fundamental units do not change over time.

I liked your comment, but I don't really agree with this, and I think  it is something which causes many people to look at natural science as a ""better"" and a more trustworthy scientific method.

[In a survey of over 1,500 natural scientists done by Nature](https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970), 52% of them believed that ""there is a significant 'crisis' of reproducibility,"" within natural science. Within Cancer biology, only 10% of the experiments were reproducable (!)

Just as people behave differently in different contexts, ""natural"" phenomena behave differently in different contexts, which natural science often does not account for.

"&gt;Aurora [Levins Morales] recalls a piece of family history. “My father’s family,” she writes, “lived in a small southern Ukrainian village where each spring, the Easter sermons sent their neighbors rampaging against the Jewish farmers and craftspeople who lived among them.”

It's always easy to whip up a mob, especially when times are hard. They make easy targets for establishments that want to distract from their own crimes or consolidate power:

&gt;\7. To people who feel deprived of a clear social identity, Ur-Fascism says that their only privilege is the most common one, to be born in the same country. This is the origin of nationalism. Besides, the only ones who can provide an identity to the nation are its enemies. Thus at the root of the Ur-Fascist psychology there is the obsession with a plot, possibly an international one. The followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia. But the plot must also come from the inside: Jews are usually the best target because they have the advantage of being at the same time inside and outside. In the US, a prominent instance of the plot obsession is to be found in Pat Robertson’s The New World Order, but, as we have recently seen, there are many others.

&gt;\8. The followers must feel humiliated by the ostentatious wealth and force of their enemies. When I was a boy I was taught to think of Englishmen as the five-meal people. They ate more frequently than the poor but sober Italians. Jews are rich and help each other through a secret web of mutual assistance. However, the followers must be convinced that they can overwhelm the enemies. Thus, by a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak. Fascist governments are condemned to lose wars because they are constitutionally incapable of objectively evaluating the force of the enemy.

&gt;https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/

The image of the wealthy Jew comes in part from usury (with politically powerful debtors incentivised to agitate for the expulsion of their creditors, of course) but that itself was part of a wider system of restricting Jewish occupations. Usury was a strong taboo amongst Christians so that was one available niche. They also managed to carve out other areas of success independently of the Christian craft guilds which excluded them, notably as merchants and in the rag trade. Restrictions on selling new goods led to the department store innovation (where they ran the building but not the shops within it) and professions like journalism and theatre were also open to those with the talent and education to make a success of it.

With the advent of the industrial revolution, urbanisation, and the increase in demand for financial capital, these discriminations ended up putting *some* Jews in a good position to flourish. That didn't end the persecution, of course. And for many poor Jews it was easier to assimilate than escape, further increasing the tendency for (European) Jews to be over-represented in the ranks of the wealthy. Hence the [socialism of fools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Bebel#Death_and_legacy), personifying capital in the image of the Jew (an approach very much encouraged by non-Jewish capitalists, of course).

&gt;The role of critical intellectuals is not to denounce anti-capitalism because it structurally resembles antisemitism. It is to differentiate the one from the other and to help others to make the same differentiation. Our task is to unmask the fact that the fundamental purpose of antisemitism is always to cover up the truth of power relations, driving wedges between Jewish and non-Jewish communities who should be united in the assertion of their common collective interests.

"Marx clarifies what he means by producing value later in chapter 7:

&gt;Let us now consider the total value of the product, the 10 lbs. of yarn. Two and a half days’ labour has been embodied in it, of which two days were contained in the cotton and in the substance of the spindle worn away, and half a day was absorbed during the process of spinning. This two and a half days’ labour is also represented by a piece of gold of the value of fifteen shillings. Hence, fifteen shillings is an adequate price for the 10 lbs. of yarn, or the price of one pound is eighteenpence.

&gt;Our capitalist stares in astonishment. The value of the product is exactly equal to the value of the capital advanced. The value so advanced has not expanded, no surplus-value has been created, and consequently money has not been converted into capital. The price of the yarn is fifteen shillings, and fifteen shillings were spent in the open market upon the constituent elements of the product, or, what amounts to the same thing, upon the factors of the labour-process; ten shillings were paid for the cotton, two shillings for the substance of the spindle worn away, and three shillings for the labour-power. The swollen value of the yarn is of no avail, for it is merely the sum of the values formerly existing in the cotton, the spindle, and the labour-power: out of such a simple addition of existing values, no surplus-value can possibly arise. [13] These separate values are now all concentrated in one thing; but so they were also in the sum of fifteen shillings, before it was split up into three parts, by the purchase of the commodities.

The total value is accounted for as merely the sum of everything that went into production.  There's no room in the equation to account for managerial overhead.  That is, even if such work counts as producing value, there's no way the wages of the manager can be paid without taking value from the worker.  

The usual counter here is that it's possible (and simply unstated in this example) for workers to voluntarily pay managers to perform non-productive, but socially necessary labor; but this leaves open a hole in Marx's entire critique.  Capitalists are themselves performing socially necessary labor by this standard, and would simply be a functioning part of the economy, rather than exploitative parasites.

Going further, communists will usually point to the idle rich, passive investors who make money while performing no labor whatsoever.  These people certainly exist, but are not typical, and not the sort of people Marx is primarily concerned with in Capital.

"My point about child abuse and sexual orientation was meant to follow my previous statement about sexual orientation as being shaped early in life, rather than during adulthood. If childhood abuse does not make people homosexual, why would negative experiences with men later in life do the trick? There is no reason to believe that happens.

Concerning bisexual women who decide not to date men after negative experiences with men, that is a more reasonable idea and it is plausible that it happens, as plausible as a man or woman deciding to not date accountants anymore because of bad experiences with accountants. But bisexual women were bisexual to begin with, they just got an extra option concerning partners (as in, beyond personality, looks, etc. they can also be attracted to both men and women).

Well, studies such as [Diamond's](http://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2007-19851-002.pdf) suggest that bisexuality is indeed a third orientation (""bisexual women’s patterns of sexual attraction are stable over time""), even though it is fluid:

&gt;\[...\] bisexuality may best be interpreted as a stable pattern of attraction to both sexes in which the specific balance of same-sex to other-sex desires necessarily varies according to interpersonal and situational factors."". Thus bisexual women remain bisexual women, but their sexual behavior might vary through time (and it so happens that if they have had, for example, sexual relationships with women recently they tend to self-report as lesbian).

Lisa Diamond's thesis is, as far as I understand it, often misrepresented, her being cited as a proponent of sexual orientation as choice. Citing from her book about sexual fluidity:

&gt;Does fluidity mean that sexual orientation is a matter of choice?  
&gt;  
&gt;No. Even when women undergo significant shifts in their patterns of erotic response, they typically report that such changes are unexpected and beyond their control. In some cases they actively resist these changes, to no avail. This finding is consistent with the extensive evidence (reviewed in Chapter 8) showing that efforts to change sexual orientation through “reparative therapy” simply do not work.

A specific answer on how many bisexual women decide to exclusively date other women because of negative experiences of abuse with men I cannot give you. I am not aware of research on this specific topic. However, in any case, these bisexual women would still be fundamentally bisexual. 

Concerning heterosexual women, there is no reason at the moment to suggest that there are heterosexual women that become lesbian because of negative experiences with men.

"Now, make sure to read my post *in full* since you want to talk about engaging in good faith.

&gt;Taste is a combination of multiple chemical variables that indeed can be expressed mathematically. Sourness is the perception of a specific number of H+ ions on the tongue, for example.

You have described ""taste"" as an attribute. This has nothing to do with my statement of preference.

&gt;Because there are multiple variables composing the domain of taste, I'll need you to be more specific about what tastes in particular you like about ice cream.

In other words, you want me to turn my aesthetic value statement--the one you ""defied"" me to describe without using numbers or comparing variables--into a quantitative statement *for you* by *adding variables to the statement*.

Nice try.

&gt;Otherwise, you are saying you value the taste of ice cream, and you value the taste of ice cream because you value the taste of ice cream, which is tautological.

That's because aesthetic judgments do not require formal logic. I don't have to *prove* my preference to you. You can believe it or not, it has no impact on my appreciation for ice cream. It's simply a statement of aesthetic value. I like ice cream because it tastes good to me. No further quantification necessary for that *value statement*.

&gt;Or, you could be more specific in how you value ice cream in comparison to other foods. How much would you be willing to pay in US dollars to experience this taste of ice cream? How ***much*** do you value it? 

You are asking me to do what you said you would do. You are asking me to turn my non-quantifiable value statement into a quantitative statement for you. I gave you a simple example of an aesthetic value, which you said you could ""formalize it into a quantitative expression."" Yet, instead of doing that, you have asked me to do it for you.

&gt;You see, to be specific, you must measure and compare values, which requires numbers. 

That's the thing, though. I don't have to be specific in my aesthetic values. I can find things beautiful, or tasty, or aurally pleasing--I can value them--without having to specify why or compare it to other things or give it a numerical attribute. I can also have moral values--I can believe things are right or wrong--without having to quantify them.

"Durkheim actually provides the tools to answer your question. To add onto OP's response, in a mechanical society we see a lower degree of labour  specialization. The number of occupations and the extent to which labour is divided is lower in societies where sameness is the glue holding  communities together. When communities have a greater division of labour, and there is more specialisation and a broader range of products and services available, the amount of individuality and diversity is  also greater.

iirc, Bangladeshi industry is primarily textile based. Over time, the economy will presumably grow and cover more areas. This will allow people to explore new specializations. As a result, the amount of sameness in the community will decrease, and more individuality will be permitted.

"There is an Australian scientist that has done great work with ritual (Rohan Kapitany). The formal explanation of ritual is that it has 'causal opacity' in that it seeks to foster some outcome (honoring; cursing, etc) by means that are indirect and, therefore, opaque. 

Here is his definition from his [2015 paper in Cognition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027715300469) (which is a well respected journal): ""For the purposes of the current research we consider rituals to be a coherent series of actions characterized by formality, repetition, redundancy, stereotypy, and causal opacity, in which performance is more important than outcome, and little variability is permitted in the action’s execution""

Given this kind of definition (the paper goes into why it is important to define it this way), it seems hard to know the mind-state of another animal enough to know what outcome it is hoping to affect.

A lot of definitions here perhaps fit other types of ideas:

1. Ceremony (a sequence of behaviors meant to give special focus to an event)
2. Tradition (a behavioral script, triggered by an event, meant to specially signify an occasion)
3. Behavioral Script (a chain of behaviors set in motion by a stimulus)

Hopefully that was informative. I actually am currently studying a corollary to rituals, so I find this pretty interesting. *edit: a word.

"It depends, and I would avoid either way answering with a straight and simple 'yes' or 'no'.

This [survey of 516 American homeless people](https://www.nhchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/vv-29-1_ptr_a8_122-136.pdf) found that:

&gt;31% of victims reported that they knew their attackers. Of those, a substantial minority (40%) identified the attacker as a friend; a small minority reported their attacker was an intimate partner; and a very small minority reported that their attacker was a family member \[...\] Victims were also asked about the housing status of their attackers. Thirty-two percent reported that the attacker was also homeless and 30% reported the attacker was housed, a quarter of whom were reported to be police officers.

Worthwhile to note that being victimized by known people, intimate others and family is a general finding in victimization.

Following [interviews with 336 homeless people in London, Oxford and Cambridge](http://homelesshub.ca/resource/living-fear-violence-and-victimisation-lives-single-homeless-people), the authors note that:

&gt;One very striking finding in the study is the prominent position of the general public as perpetrators of crimes against homeless people. In the major categories of criminal victimization – burglary, violence, threats, sexual assault, and criminal damage – respondents reported that the perpetrator had been a member of the public. The exception was theft where other homeless people appear slightly more likely to have been the perpetrators than were members of the public.

A more recent [survey of 458 homeless (or previously homeless) people in England and Wales](https://www.crisis.org.uk/media/20502/crisis_its_no_life_at_all2016.pdf) found that:

&gt;In over half (55%) of the latest incidences of people being hit or kicked a member of the public unknown to the respondent was responsible \[...\] In 56 per cent (124) of most recent threats of violence, the main perpetrators of such acts against rough sleepers were members of the general public \[and\] a small proportion of respondents (6%/25) disclosed that they had been sexually assaulted, interfered with or attacked in the past 12 months. Again in most cases the perpetrator was a member of the public.

In short, victimization of homeless people by members of the general public should not be dismissed.

"&gt;Kids learn to produce words earlier and faster in signed languages versus spoken languages.

That's still just one aspect of language though. Concatenated words isn't the same as having ""learned"" the grammar. The issue I brought up was that, if taken as a whole, there's no indication that any one language is hands down easier for L1 acquisition. That a toddler embraces signing for basic stuff is not contrary to that at all. I know a handful of hearing parents who teach their kids signs, including family members of mine, and it's great, no argument there, but that's not the same thing as ASL/Auslan/BSL as an L1 which then gets continued on, especially when it's parents who are not themselves proficient in sign that are spearheading it. I think it's an incredibly important distinction to make between [gestures taken from ASL being employed without a larger context to express things] and [child learning ASL].

You could make the same argument that languages without fricatives or rhoticity are easier because the kid has a head start by not having to try to emulate sounds that their mouths may not yet really make all that well.

"&gt; 1) If you think that is all there is to personal financial success you have a long way to go

Why lead with a line like that? You have no idea about my knowledge of finance or how I manage money.

Back to the main topic: Sure, there’s more useful knowledge than “save 15% in a target date fund”, but apparently many people don’t even do that. So it still seems a problem of motivation as much as complex knowledge.

I’ll be the first to admit I don’t have knowledge of money management for low incomes. My line of thought should be considered applicable mainly to middle-class Americans. But I wouldn’t expect low-income money management to be more complex. I would expect mistakes to be costlier.

The taboo is important: I bet that does make it harder for people to gain both knowledge and motivation. My impression is that many Americans are simply not socialized to think of the long term and to take action to protect their long-term interests. Many people seem not to understand what it really means to need to pay back a loan — they can say it in words, but it doesn’t integrate with the rest of their thought and behavior.

I think farmers and hunter-gatherers must have developed customs that worked in the long term, perhaps in most cases not even really knowing what they’re doing. We haven’t had centuries to develop customs for the modern economy. What I don’t understand is why those old prudential habits haven’t carried over more.

"Fair cop!

Mainstream economics has several problems. Here are a few of the common critiques of microeconomy (the core of neoliberal economic thinking):

1 - starts with bad assumptions regarding consumer and firm behavior that go counter to all psychology, marketing, behavioral economics etc.

2 - justify these assumptions making wild claims on aggregate behavior that ignore several fields of physics / mathematics

3 - prove that their claims on aggregation are only valid when under incredibly strict irrealistic conditions (SMD conditions) 

4 - assert that we should consider the economy to be in a state of equilibrium (presumably because using poincare maps to describe trajectories is hard?) which is practically AND theoretically impossible

5 - ignore the relevant results on the stability of that equilibrium

6 - claim that trying to reach an unstable equilibrium is the best course of action

7 - play these problems against each other as if two wrong make a right (e.g. We don't have to justify this inconsistency in the model because it's a wildly irrealistic approximation anyway!)

"The case that you are referring to as mentioned in Revisionist history was actually the case of Emmett Till that I mentioned. I didn’t get in to the fact that the consequences of sex that this woman was trying to escape were that she was cheating on her husband with a black man in the Jim Crow era South but it’s still in line with my point.

Race-based false rape accusations here aren’t the epidemic but merely a symptom of them. The justice system in the Jim Crow South was essentially designed to round up black Americans and to try them without due process.

The good news is that your question weighs a lot less heavily today because of civil rights and women’s liberation. A woman often has to fight to be seen as a victim of sexual assault and a black man is far less likely to be seen with such outright prejudice as an inherent predator. It should also be mentioned that the tragedy of Emmett Till was that he was murdered by the woman’s husband. This was (for the time) not a miscarriage of justice by the courts.

But to answer your question more directly, I don’t think that we should ignore the motivations for women to make false accusations when they are made but how many women are motivated these days by escaping the social consequences of sleeping with a black man?

"On at least one occasion, the Egyptians of the New Kingdom collected the penises of their foes to tally the fallen after a battle.

"This is a very difficult issue.  On one hand, we want to reduce stigma surrounding mental illness.  On the other, we want to provide the public with accurate information about mental illness.

&gt;People with mental illness are actually more likely to be a victim of violence than perpetrate it. 

This is a very common answer to the question of whether mentally ill people are more violent than others, and it's a misleading one.  While true (actually, it's true of nearly all people, as there are far more victims of violence than perpetrators of violence in the world, given that the latter tend to perpetrate violence against multiple people), it is also true that those with mental illness are more likely to perpetrate violence than the general population.  The study you linked even found this to be the case, despite doing its best to beat around the bush about it (for understandable reasons):

&gt;Although the majority of adults with mental illnesses do not perpetrate violence, the devastating impact of violence in this population is not to be minimized. Our data and previous findings showed increased risk of violence associated with mental illness.

In fact, almost all of the research on this topic has found quite a strong correlation between having a mental illness and perpetrating violence (even when controlling for substance abuse).  Of course, it's important to note that this varies significantly by diagnosis.  For example, although it seems safe to assume that people with diagnoses like anorexia nervosa are not at increased risk for the perpetration of violence, it is known quite well that diagnoses like schizophrenia and certain personality disorders are very strong predictors of violence perpetration (in some cases, [the risk is around 1.5 times higher](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19702378)).  Substance use disorders have the strongest correlation with violence.

So, yeah, this is tricky.  My dissertation involved quite a lot of research on the link between mental illness and violence, and it was hard for me to digest.",NA,FALSE,NA,"Rain12913",NA,NA,1540130125,"t5_2sml9","t3_9q2b7e","t1_e863lav",25,1541296594,0,0,"e86cfkm","AskSocialScience",NA,NA,NA
"You seem pretty determined to blame this on prosperity and discipline but without much evidence to support it beyond an overly romantic view of the “old prudential habits” of farmers. Most of these people died early, were malnourished most of their lives, and poor. They are called subsistence farmers because they didn’t do a particularly good job at it. They subsisted.  That doesn’t suggest they did a particularly good job or resource management. People have always had trouble planning for the future and managing resources. Modernization hasn’t changed that. It’s built in to our brains. I’m not sure what mythical agrarian society you think had these far seeing farmers. I’m not aware of them.

You also seem determined to ignore how complex modern financial life is for middle class and low income Americans. You make the claim that this advice would work for middle class Americans, yet ignore the fact that middle class Americans have to deal with all the problems I just outlined, and your rule doesn’t do anything to answer those issues.  Middle class Americans don’t have 401ks. Only 14% of Americans are even offered a [401k](https://www.fool.com/retirement/2017/06/19/does-the-average-american-have-a-401k.aspx) by their employer. Not to mention a match. There are thousands of apps, financial consulting companies, and websites dedicated to overcoming finically complexity. None of them say “just save 15% for retirement”. The questions I lay out apply to well over 3/4 of the population and only get harder as you go down the income ladder.

Also you are particularly wrong about financial complexity getting easier as you get poorer. The opposite is true. The poor have much more complexity that they must overcome. Studying this is literally my job, so I’m happy to talk more about it.

Just one example: the credit paradox. In order to better your situation (get an education, job training, etc) you generally need to borrow money. If you are poor you have less financial tools available to you and they are more costly. This makes it harder to improve your credit and manage your financial  situation . If you have bad credit it’s hard to get a loan. If you can’t get a loan, you can’t improve your credit. 

What should you do? There are thousands of predatory loans that are easy to get, incredibly expensive, and hard to understand. These companies are much more profitable so their marketing budgets are large and they are good at make their products sound cheap. If you fall for this trap, you’ll end up more in debt with worse credit. If you spend ages reading and educating yourself about credit, you might make a good decision and not fall for it. You might find some government program or non profit that helps low income people. But you still have to get small loans and spend years building your credit before you can improve your score enough to take out the kind of loans you need to improve your life. There are dozens of complex problems to understand and solve here that middle class people don’t have to deal with. And none of them are to do with retirement savings.

The point is that, yes, being poor makes financial decisions more costly, but they are also more complex.   

You accused me of not having any idea what your level of financial knowledge is, and to some extent you are right.  I don’t know if you are just young and never had to actually manage a complex financial life or if you are privileged enough to think it’s normal to be employed, have little debt, and have a job where a 401k is standard but either way I know that you are grossly understating the complexity of financial life in America in 2018. You are also over stating the success of primitive farmers. Both are distorting your view on the matter.  

At this point nothing I type is going to be sufficient. Read the report I linked to on financial decision making in my original post. Or maybe this video on our perception of [wealth ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ATl6ZN6gAeQ)  distribution in America will help? Read some books about the lives of agrarian farmers and hunter gatherers? Sapiens by yuval noah harari might be a good start.

"A few reasons.

Xanax and other benzos [haven’t received the public backlash or crackdown that opioids have](https://www.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/paxg39/the-mystery-of-the-terrifying-xanax-resurgence-in-america). They remain relatively easy to get and are more associated with bored housewives than hardcore addicts. 

Because they are so easy to get they are cheap. You can get a bar for like $5. 

Mixing benzos with opioids and alcohol can heighten the effect of the opioid, making them a good option when you can’t get enough of your drug of choice. Benzo-use is highest among users of other drugs, and [30% of opioid overdoses involve some kind of benzo](https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/opioids/benzodiazepines-opioids). They are also popular for users of uppers like molly or blow to come down after a night of partying.

There have been concerns about the “Xanax epidemic” since as early as 2000.

"Happiness being subjective, it does not *entirely* correlate with objective quality of life. For example, the [Easterlin paradox](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3012515/) describes the observation that ""at a point in time both among and within nations, happiness varies directly with income, but over time, happiness does not increase when a country's income increases"" and this is even though in the short term it appears that both go together. This is explained by Easterlin as the result of comparison, hedonic adaptation and scaling aspirations:

&gt;But clearly, the escalation of material aspirations with economic  growth, reflecting the impact of social comparison and hedonic adaptation, are of central importance. No evidence has been forthcoming to suggest that poorer countries are somehow exempt from escalating material aspirations as income rises.

[It is however not a settled matter](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-104-2-267.pdf) and in any case it is probably not as simple as the above statement:

&gt;Our findings indicate that for rising income to be most likely to influence \[subjective well-being (SWB)\] it must lead to greater optimism, financial satisfaction, and household material prosperity. In the cases where these factors move in the opposite direction from income, they can mask the effects of income on SWB. Thus, where optimism about the future is low, or aspirations for income are rising very quickly, higher incomes may not be associated with higher SWB.

However, even though happiness *is* relative, there are limits to this statement, [as it is not *exclusively* based upon comparison](https://personal.eur.nl/veenhoven/Pub1990s/91a-full.pdf) and relative needs:

&gt;This point is neatly illustrated by the case of Western Europe. At the end of World War II happiness was low in England, France, the Netherlands, and West Germany. The level of living was low as well, housing shortage and food rationing being the rule. Between 1948 and 1975 these countries witnessed both a startling economic recovery and a general rise in happiness. The percentage of unhappy persons in the population was halved during that period (Veenhoven, 1984, p. 171).",NA,FALSE,NA,"Revue_of_Zero",NA,NA,1540061897,"t5_2sml9","t3_9pg8e0","t3_9pg8e0",1,1541270881,0,0,"e84te7b","AskSocialScience",NA,NA,NA

That said, although I generally tend to disagree with Jurij, I do however agree with him in this instance - in this subreddit, assertions such that moral panics are predominantly a right-wing phenomenon should be substantiated.

And when you ""obliged"" him earlier, you didn't provide sources yet again, to support your points regarding moral panics. I am not commenting on how *correct* or *false* those statements are, just that his request is in principle fair. As in, it is fair not to take anyone simply by their word, especially in a subreddit dedicated to science-based answers.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, getting to the meat of the discussion - In of itself, as Cohen explains, moral panic is a neutral term. However, it can be argued that insofar that moral panics revolve around the notion of societal interests undermined by morally-laden threats, it is a phenomenon most often associated with conservative fears and anxieties, insofar that conservatism is about defending traditional values and mores.

This is true even while admitting that arguments can be made for certain moral panics being associated to certain liberal groups, [such as moral crusades against pornography and prostitution.](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0032329207304319) Similarly, [Goode and Ben-Yehuda](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Moral+Panics%3A+The+Social+Construction+of+Deviance%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9781405189347), when arguing that there is no *inherent* leftist slant to the concept, also point out that some feminist groups ""whose adherents claim some affiliation with leftists politics, seem to have taken up the satanic child molestation and murder cause"" in both the USA and the UK, which goes against the idea that the satanic ritual abuse moral panic was a *uniquely* conservative, for which u/JurijFedorov was asking a source. Another example are fears about nuclear power plants. In conclusion:

&gt;Thus, while, as a general rule, analysts of moral panics have *tended* *to be* leftist in their political views, observers of any political stripe could use the concept to understand the mobilization and social organization of exaggerated social fears.",NA,FALSE,NA,"Revue_of_Zero",NA,NA,1539035051,"t5_2sml9","t3_9mavt7","t1_e7eg43g",1,1540834992,0,0,"e7ezaqk","AskSocialScience",NA,NA,NA

"&gt; but the person who is paying rent knows this and willingly entered the exchange because there are ""short-term"" advantages to rent

&gt; if the person lives there for so long that they pay more than what a permanent place costs, that's on them for not just buying a permanent place.

That's not how any of this works and you should know that. Most people end up living their whole life in a rented apartment. They *can't* buy the apartment. If you ask 10 people in any big city that are renting whether they'd buy the apartment they're in if they could 9 would be like ""heck yeah where do I sign"". People are ""willingly choosing rent over owning property"", they are forced into disadvantageous exploitative relationships because they cannot do anything else. You need a house to live. It's not like borrowing 10 bucks from a friend, it's a massive investment that people can't afford, and keeping rent high makes sure they will never be able to afford it.

---

But you wanted the ideological position of rent as inherently exploitative in any circumstance, so here it is: all private property of the means of production is exploitative. You are essentially arguing that it comes down to a personal preference, as it is basically a financial strategy choice of having to pay more but delayed instead of all right now - but that creates a system that rewards ""having right now"" i.e. being born into wealth.

Let's go through an example. Say that Abel and Beth are living in New York City. Abel and Beth both need a house to live in, because the human condition is such that there are necessary things common to everyone. As they won a contest, they are both presented with very advantageous choices compared to everyone else: they can choose to buy a house outright for 100k, cash, within two days, or they can choose to rent a house with a capped rent until they die, monthly payments of 1k. What would they choose? Unless they are very very weird, they would both choose the first option. It is incredibly advantageous after only a few years, and even if they need to move, they can still rent the damn apartment and finance their new one. It's a steal. Why would they not buy? It's incredibly cost efficient!

Except Abel is poor and doesn't have, never had, and probably never will have 100k on hand. Beth gets to pay less, own property, have a safety net, turn a nice profit in just a few years and overall get richer in a safer situation, while Abel needs to go month by month praying that they meet the required (low!) payment of 1k or they're evicted, homeless, and will likely get imprisoned and end up serving as a slave in the private prison sector.

Thinking that people choose rent because ""they like it more"" is thinking from the point of view of someone who always had the choice. Most people don't get to make that choice, because they aren't born in a wealthy family. The people that are born into wealth, meanwhile, will happily get all the compounding advantages of having that money in the first place.

Rent is exploitative because insisting that people deserve a return on investment is insisting that rich people need to be paid because they're rich, and that the only reason that people don't choose the safer, better option is because ""there are short term advantages"" that they must be preferring to the other option that they *obviously* have access to. But they don't.

---

You may feel at this point that I have argued only in the specific reality we live in (I don't think arguing in hypotheticals is preferred but hey) and that I haven't explained why *all* rent in *all* possible realities are inherently exploitative, so here's a few more considerations:

1) If the owner finds rent to be a good option for them, it must be a net profit, meaning it is overall preferrable to own rather than to rent.

2) If the two parties are fully free to enter whatever contract they wish, you could argue that they'd find a position that is perfectly even between the two, with everyone equally satisfied. This is a nice thought, but it disregards reality: power relations make it so that one side has all the chips in this bargaining. We live in a society where money is power, and the owner by definition has the most money. Not only that, but the owner has safety, while the renter needs to rent or they will be homeless. This is an intrinsic threat of violence that the owner doesn't even need to state, it is always present and distorts the bargaining - is a bargain truly entered freely by both parties if one is holding the other at gunpoint? Same goes for the job market by the way - people die if they don't work, and that is an implicit threat of violence that employers have over employees, distorting bargaining. You could argue that employees have a similar threat in letting the employer without anybody that works for them but that leads us to...

3) collective bargaining and the importance of unions. The necessity to rebalance the power relations between employer / landlord and normal folks is why unions were invented in the first place. Unions got us things like the weekend, or decent work hours, through massive protests, strikes, and violent actions. It was a huge struggle to establish the power of the union and the verisimilitude of the threat of implied violence during bargaining. This is no longer there, and we are back to incredibly exploitative behavior from employers.

4) The threats are still not really symmetrical. Remember that while one category of people is having their livelihood threatened indirectly, the indirect threat on the capitalist class is for them to stop being capitalist and return to being working class. It says a lot that the threat of having to go back to selling your time and renting is so much that it somewhat balances the threat of being left to die of exposure in the middle of a street.

As a result of these considerations, a picture of society emerges where rent is inherently exploitative (in a capitalist society) because it is always preferrable to be an owner wherever possible, as it is safer and more profitable, and where owners collectively have the most power and use it to maximize their profits and personal interests, with threats of (indirect) violence on those they are extracting value from, which leads to exploitation.",NA,FALSE,NA,"TheMormegil92",NA,NA,1540805594,"t5_2sml9","t3_9r8v0k","t1_e8gfheb",2,1541586834,0,0,"e8njwt0","AskSocialScience",NA,NA,NA

"According to Diamond, who is credited with the term and is invested in this topic of research, ""one of the fundamental, defining features of female sexual orientation is its fluidity"". Thus it's a characteristic of sexual orientation, with women apparently being more fluid than men. It ""operates in concert with sexual orientation to influence how her attractions, fantasies, behaviors, and affections are experienced and expressed over the life course. Fluidity implies not that women’s desires are endlessly variable but that some women are capable of a wider variety of erotic feelings and experiences than would be predicted on the basis of their self-described sexual orientation alone"".

Even considering fluidity, I would expect that a heterosexual woman falling for a *specific* woman to be specific case, rather than something more generalized and voluntary as ""swearing off men"". Maybe future research exploring fluidity further will reveal something about how rare or not such a case is.

There is however a caveat. The above example (such as the one in the article you cited) is actually making the distinction between romantic attraction and sexual attraction, which is however (arguably) rarely made. These two are most often considered to go together, or otherwise research is mostly focused on *sexual* attraction. Whether love exists, what is love and whether romantic attraction is separate from sexual attraction is a rarely asked open question as far as I am aware of. I'd say the most obvious illustration is that this topic is the domain of *sex*ology. Thus it also becomes even more complicated to parse...

In any case, at least for bisexuals, I'd say it wouldn't be amazing that bisexual women who have been abused by men decide to just engage with women. I am skeptical regarding heterosexual women, at least for sexual attraction. Romantic attraction ***maybe*** and still it wouldn't be under their control, it'd be an infatuation with a specific person in a specific time and context. But I cannot affirm this empirically at the moment.

Still, I would be skeptical towards the idea that childhood abuse predisposes and abusive relationships in adulthood triggers this kind of phenomenon. There are many studies on victimization and repeat victimization, I would assume that if someone found that their sample of victims suddenly became engaged in same-sex relationships, there would be a lot of noise about it. It could be that nobody was looking thus nobody could notice, and I won't flatly deny it ever happens - it wouldn't be unimaginable that some specific women who were repeatedly abused decided to, say, become political lesbians and then, maybe, developed a non-sexual infatuation for another woman. Maybe such an outlier exists. Doubt there's any evidence of this, anyway.

Re: percentage of bisexuals, [in the USA it seems to be around 0.7%.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/health-survey-gives-government-its-first-large-scale-data-on-gay-bisexual-population/2014/07/14/2db9f4b0-092f-11e4-bbf1-cc51275e7f8f_story.html?utm_term=.e59a63e35d9f) It might be higher, if many bisexual people self-report as either straight or gay/lesbian because they have only had sex with a specific gender in the previous years.

"Seems to me you are moving goalposts. But I will indulge anyway. As I do not know what you consider to be the ""narrative of why ""reducitvism"" is bad"", excuse me if my answer fits that definition:

First of all, I would distinguish different kinds of reductionism. I was not using its term as used in the social science when objecting to your criticism about qualitative research - what I was referring to was reductionism in the sense of reducing the subject to a few elements (case studies, their validity notwithstanding, bad apples, etc.) while distorting it. And by ""reductionist and ignorant"" I was referring to how in my opinion you were distorting the subject by providing a partial picture of what qualitative research is and ignoring why it exists and is considered as a kind of scientific research by social scientists. You might have understood better if I had written that you were misconstruing what qualitative research is, distorting its characteristics and making a hasty or faulty generalization.

Regarding reductionism re: your definition of science, I disagree because social science (and science in general) is not simply about distilling reality to some elements. You are *over*simplifying it.

While it is good practice to choose the simpler explanatory model if two differently complex models are equally as good at explaining or predicting a phenomenon, that does not mean that social scientists should engage in, for example, psychological reductionism or biological reductionism.

In other words, the issue with reductionism is that it implies attempting to explain complex realities, in which several factors play a role and interact with eachother, and/or to distill phenomena in which multiple processes with different factors co-interact to a few elements. The biological, social and psychological should be (and are) considered in the social sciences, for example. Reality is not purely psychological, sociological or biological, nor should scientific explanations and models reduce to only one of these dimensions. And to conclude, multiple levels of analysis are deployed in social science, from the micro to the macro, the individual to the societal. 

Intermediary explanations, specific studies, etc. - sure, they attempt to take a bite without trying to explain *everything*. No study can be or should be expected to be all-encompassing. That does not mean that *science* is reductionist.

By the way, ""It is essential to reduce specific cases to general classifications"" - that is generalization, not reduction, which is why samples have to be representative.

"Personality is influenced both by biology and environment. But what personality trait is associated to a gender (in the sense of defining it) is determined by society. This is where the concept of gender expression and conformity are useful. An effeminate biologically male man can still perceive themselves as male and identify as such, however their gender expression would be considered non-conformist. ""Not much of a man"". But this is a value judgment by people, according to their culture and attitudes, which determines what it ""means"" to be a man.

Another example is tomboys, when a girl is not considered ""much of a girl"" if she acts like a boy. There is nothing wrong with a tomboy, there is no dysphoria or personality disorder. Their personality is different, just like how two men can have entirely different personalities and likes. But society determined (this is not necessarily a voluntary process!) that men and women have specific traits. This is what gender is about.

To affirm that gender is a social construct does not mean that what a society decides is ""male"" is entirely arbitrary. But it is based on stereotypes and it is applied generally, like any other categorization. For argument's sake, even if you observe that men are often aggressive, it does not equal ""all men are aggressive"" and you don't *have* to decide that a defining trait of males is aggressiveness, and that for women it's meekness. In any case, as per the definition of gender, it includes all traits (such as personality traits) and characteristics (such as appearance) that are associated to a biological sex, but can also *not* be associated to it depending on, yet again, time and space.

P.S. Ironically for my example, the concept itself of ""effeminate"" is dependent on how gender is defined in my environment today. What I think of effeminate today might be quite different in the future.

"I mean, to say that it is not important to worry about how they impacted the development of capitalism is only true if you aren't looking to critique modern capitalism or historical materialism. 

The importance of Weber's work is to (like other economic historians), point out that markets and capitalism have at times been ""embedded"" in different cultures - and that homo economicus doesn't really exist, but is the result of a culture that promotes the acceptance of markets and wealth accumulation.

As for the importance of Calvinism specifically 

""Calvinism has several major doctrines. It rejects consubstantiation (a Lutheran doctrine), views grace as irresistible, has a rigid doctrine of predestination, and originally had a theocratic view of the state. The Calvinist doctrines look on God's will as sovereign, and that the church should not be subject to the state (although this led to the church dominated societies of Geneva and parts of New England). The doctrine of predestination is preeminent in Calvinism, ""stressing the absolute sovereignty of God’s will, held that only those whom God specifically elects are saved, that this election is irresistible, and that man can do nothing to effect this salvation."" (Columbia Encyclopedia, p. 428)."" 
http://uregina.ca/~gingrich/318n1302.htm

According to Weber this did a few things

1.) Led protestants to a really isolationist theology and broke down communal bonds, people became much more individualistic.

2.) If being saved is predetermined (predestination) and no amount of work can change that, people begin to accumulate wealth as a sign that they are clearly favored. Cognitive biases encourage one to look for (and create) signs that they are God's chosen ones.

Whether the thesis is correct or not is, of course, a matter of empirical debate. The ideas that drive the thesis are fairly significant in the field.

"I don't think you can say, unambiguously, ""yes."" Marx was unquestionably brilliant in some of his analysis, but his most important prediction - the inevitable collapse of the system, followed by the working class taking control - has never happened. So it's always risky to say ""Yes, Marx got everything right"" when his most important prediction failed to come true. Veblen's response to Marx, along with Schumpeter's, probably help explain why that prediction didn't come to pass.

That said, he is unquestionably a towering figure in political economy and many of his concepts remain influential. Some have been discarded (labor theory of value, and the related transformation problem), but many remain with us not only in political economy but in the popular discourse. The concept of the middle class, for example, has roots in Marx. The idea that the superstructure is built on the underlying economic arrangement, but that the economic arrangement tends to move faster than the superstructure is IMO the most apt way to describe today's problems, where economics is unquestionably global but regulation and law are overwhelmingly domestic.

"&gt;I wanted to start my reply by thanking you for an engaging and polite discourse. I've enjoyed our conversation and think that even though we might come from somewhat different fields we are able to discuss the similarities fairly well.

Same here!

&gt;At the risk of beating a dead horse that we really seem to agree on, the stance all my criticisms come from is that once a possible flaw in our system is exposed, we should take it seriously and work toward it.

I think the issue, though, is what flaws have actually been exposed? According to the authors of the article, it is a dangerous pervasive rot both *in academia* and *in gender studies specifically* (notice the vast majority of their articles were aimed at gender-related journals. That's not an accident).

&gt;I think we can speed methodological and process advancement up a bit if we take scenarios like this, fraudulent data, p-hacking, and general poor methodological practices seriously.

Honestly, I thought we (as a social science community) were already taking these things quite seriously. If they weren't taken seriously, the journals would not have retracted the articles after accepting them, right? Retraction is itself the process working as it should, to correct errors in the scientific record. I think you'd be hard-pressed to find people who think none of those things are serious issues.

&gt;I do think that we might need to consider whether science can exist in the ivory tower any longer or if we need to accept that our research can and is interpreted and extended by people with agendas.

Totally agree. Here is what I personally run up against in taking that approach to my own work: I am called an ""activist"" because I am not ""simply reporting objective facts."" We *all* have agendas. The question is why is my agenda (a lot of what I do involves gender/sexuality theory) considered ""too political"" while the agendas of the hoax authors are not?

&gt;I'm reluctant to say these authors were acting in bad faith because they may have thought this was a necessary body of ""research""

There are several reasons I say it was bad faith: (1) a ""hoax"" is by its nature about tricking people (good-faith scholarship would engage with the literature to try to critique/move/shape it, rather than just shit all over it); (2) two of the authors have previously tried a ""hoax"" by publishing an article in a pay-to-publish predatory journal and then claiming they had proved that gender studies is completely corrupt--this new hoax is an extension of that, based on political motives rather than academic ones; (3) those same two authors have tweeted and re-tweeted some alt-right stuff (I believe it's discussed in one of the articles I first shared), which to me is indicative of bad faith in these hoaxes; (4) they engage in the same kind of pseudosciency stuff they criticize, for example by claiming in their summary article that they engaged in ""reflexive ethnography,"" but what they did was neither reflexive nor ethnographic.

&gt;If something that is pure garbage can make it in, then things that are pretty close but not right certainly do. \[...\]  The ability for a hoax to be written using pieced together papers suggests to me that there wasn't a rock solid framework there because the editors and many of the reviewers didn't immediately flag the papers. 

In at least one of their hoax journal articles (the final link in the list I gave does a good job breaking this down), everything before the discussion section is more or less plausible, though one reviewer said it read like a bad student paper (notably, and another reason I think what they did was in bad faith, they presented that reviewer's comments as evidence of corruption in these fields, but that reviewer publicly identified himself and said he rejected the paper but offered constructive comments to try to help improve the paper, which is what ethical peer reviewers *should be doing*). It was in the discussion section that they went hog wild, but people regularly make odd speculations in discussion sections. If the majority of the paper was plausible and looked like it was based on sound observational evidence but there were some questionable comments in the discussion section they refused to remove based on reviewer comments, does that make the article ""pure garbage""? The way they presented empirical evidence in the majority of the paper would lead me to believe that it was a good faith, if not misguided, submission if I were a reviewer. The hoax authors have misrepresented a lot of their ""findings"" and cherry-picked information to share, which is another reason I believe they are not engaged in good-faith academic work but rather in politically-motivated ""gotcha"" journalism.

Again, while I do think there's problems with peer review, I don't think their hoax has demonstrated what they've claimed it does, and any other problems we interpret to be brought to light because of this hoax are *already things we know are problematic*, so the hoax actually tells us no new information at all.

&gt;I think that in order to fully develop the social sciences we will need to start operationalizing multiple theories in the same study and putting them into the same models in ways that let us differentiate which theories are better explanations under specific scenarios. 

I think this is where specific critiques of specific approaches is warranted. ""Models"" aren't something all social sciences engage in building. There will always be people who think some theories are better than others and who can make convincing arguments for their position, and then there are people who can make convincing counter-arguments. There will never be *one true correct way* to explain social phenomena because, as you say (and I agree) they rarely have a single source of influence or cause.

&gt;In a dream scenario, we would be able to explain 100% of the variance in human behavior and it would certainly take a ton of theories to do that. 

I guess this is where the pragmatist (hehe) in me comes out and says I don't have much use for dream scenarios and would rather focus on what works and what doesn't. We will never reach a point of explaining 100% of human behavior--in fact, it seems like the more we learn the harder it is to explain.

&gt;I think that your mention that they didn't use the theory properly aligns with my general stance. If the misuse of a theory can slip through even one reviewer, that makes me think the system needs some work. Maybe it means we need to change the review system (we do) and maybe it means we need to make theories more defined (I think we do). 

Well, I agree that in an ideal world reviewers would be able to catch every single issue like this. But reviewers are unpaid volunteer labor, usually overworked academics (including graduate students, who haven't spent decades working with such theories but are only just beginning to grasp them). I certainly think Butler's performativity theory is well defined, but it's often misinterpreted (not least in part due to her writing style, which can be impenetrable to some--it took me about four reads of *Gender Trouble* and reading some of her other work before I started to fully grasp her framework). It's certainly not perfect, and people have made great strides in pushing it in new directions, and there's been many great criticisms of it as well. But it's complicated because *gender is complicated*. There will never be a simple explanation for gender and sexuality in humans, and any framework that claims to completely explain it in simple terms and is easily understood by people who have never thought critically about gender is automatically suspect to me for not being robust enough to capture nuance.

That said, I think we definitely agree that the peer review system is imperfect and, while it works okay most of the time, we should definitely keep working to fix it or implement new systems that work better.",NA,FALSE,NA,"anthrowill","Medical Anthropology",NA,1539621577,"t5_2sml9","t3_9noxmp","t1_e7sde5l",3,1541078502,0,0,"e7tdj68","AskSocialScience",NA,NA,"anthro"

"O.K., as I stated, it is inherent with society to have *deviance*, but what is *deviant* varies because it depends on a given group's norms (formal or informal), as Howard Becker (*Outsiders*) and Émile Durkheim (*Rules of Sociological Method*) explain. Deviance, such as criminal behavior, serves a social function, as it allows society to define what is allowed. 

That said, a classic approach to distinguishing modern Western countries and many East Asian countries is by distinguishing between [individualistic and collectivistic cultures](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-349-08120-2_3). The idea is that individualistic societies promote personal achievements, attitudes and values, while collectivistic societies promote shared achievements, attitudes and values. Thus there are studies that explored how, [for example](http://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/1999-11645-010.html?casa_token=J7efTd60hTwAAAAA:lYe8JC-oN7KNYAYVX7Y4-0DkT8pP0HxYhg1D-eJ_gHDPSRW2V_2WYSVzfvfMO2QqJNhueJlK5KDfuQkY1GqcIA), ""East Asians preferred targets that represented conformity, whereas European Americans preferred targets that represented uniqueness"". Different cultures, different norms, different values and expectations pressured upon people.


The social psychological literature about what influences behavior (what allows to persuade people to act as we want, and dissuade from acting against how we want) highlights the [importance of social norms](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0146167208316691?casa_token=F9_653gbNwcAAAAA:adZkQI_s5I1j-HYIKZ7ssokEdF1VW5W6iAAdqgAkw2b7gv2qp3IyjQ_lTFtgrDq1j4X2r_J0qDQ5). Norms can be distinguished between [injunctive and descriptive](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~prestos/Downloads/DC/pdfs/Krupka_Oct13_Cialdinietal1990.pdf). The former is ""how you ought to behave"" and the latter is ""how most people behave"". What norm is salient and more effective varies. 


Now add these notions together. For example, [this study](https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/42506336/The_impact_of_individualist_and_collecti20160209-26039-j85dpy.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1540392655&amp;Signature=NRHWYrlTIeuZeE6S5Of1BL8eO20%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DThe_impact_of_individualist_and_collecti.pdf) ""found more positive evaluations of dissenting group members when norms prescribed individualism rather than collectivism"". But it is also important to note that ""an individualist norm does not make any kind of behavior acceptable to group members, nor does it make the members turn a blind eye to dissent.""

Thus, take a collectivistic society that injunctions people to conform entirely ('[the nail that sticks up gets hammered down')](https://www.tofugu.com/japan/conformity-in-japan/), in which most people behave in a manner to [save face](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_\(sociological_concept\)) and in which non-conformity is strongly stigmatized, then you will observe different behaviors. However, this does not mean that there are no [drinkers](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2014/08/30/lifestyle/dealing-addiction-japans-drinking-problem/), [gamblers](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/07/31/business/already-suffering-slowdown-japans-pachinko-industry-now-braces-gambling-addiction-regulations/) and party animals in Japan, for example. 

For your specific example, Bangladesh strongly restricts alcohol use via legislation, which cannot be glossed over and colors your premise differently. And this [study by WHO](http://www.searo.who.int/bangladesh/publications/alcohol_consumption_rev1.pdf.pdf) found that ""those who do use alcohol frequently binge drink"".

In sum, what you observe is not an actual absence of deviants in any given society (it is unlikely that there is any society with *no* ""social rebels""), but rather the differences in what is considered normative and deviant and how deviance is expressed, how culture influences attitudes, norms, beliefs, and how much people are pressured to not be deviant either by formal norms (laws), or informal norms.",NA,FALSE,NA,"Revue_of_Zero",NA,NA,1540389843,"t5_2sml9","t3_9qw4w9","t3_9qw4w9",5,1541407689,0,0,"e8cy21e","AskSocialScience",NA,NA,NA

Adam smith articulated a similar labor theory of value in the wealth of nations.  Economists do not take that any more seriously either.

Modern economics has nothing to do with smith vs Marx.   The problem with Marx is that a lot of his economics is normative (which economists mostly don’t do today), and where his economics is positive, it is difficult to put into a model that does a good job explaining facts and is faithful to marx’s Writing.

"The literature on attitudes, bias and affiliated topics is extensive and complex. But broadly speaking, being aware of biases may not be a sufficient solution to behave differently. For example, [motivation to control prejudiced reactions](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167297233009?casa_token=hG1kGbUzQCkAAAAA:SRp0biNXbFnq3soL4vO2egbTtGlHrILsNksnntSq2mCZtQeVVu0AAnr1EhxBAnegZ7UPEYZ6SLvq) is also an important factor, which might stem either from concern not to appear prejudiced, or desire to avoid conflict.

Controlling prejudiced reactions also requires [mental efforts](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7c67/24f46fb137a94c5f41e957ae01f9ebf241a7.pdf), such that those who have implicit biases (such as an automatic tendency to associate Black people with guns) and who are ego-depleted (reduced mental resources caused by another mentally engaging task) are more likely to apply stereotypes.

"This is a great answer, but I think that it glosses over the answer to a part of OP's question.

Specifically the research is pretty clear that signed languages have a significant advantage in early-stage productive vocabulary acquisition. Kids learn to produce words earlier and faster in signed languages versus spoken languages. This early advantage gradually disappears and before long kids tend to have similar levels of vocabulary and fluency by school age regardless of the language.

The most popular hypotheses I have seen to explain this put forward teasons like: 1) the articulators in signed languages are much easier to see (and therefore to mimic). In spoken languages only the lips are easily visible on others and it's impossible for to see any of your own articulators, whereas a child can see other's hands and their own. 2) the onset of the gesturing stage happens at around the same time as kids learning signed languages start picking up vocabulary and they may be a synergistic effect.",NA,FALSE,NA,"El-Kurto",NA,NA,1539956213,"t5_2sml9","t3_9pe0w0","t1_e815ht0",1,1541226731,0,0,"e826u5u","AskSocialScience",NA,NA,NA

By the way, are you only interested in the contribution of sociology to the understanding of ""people around us"" and/or whether sociological literature can be applied to specific cases (local/hometown/...)? I'm asking because the title sounds general, and the social sciences also include psychology (in which one can find social psychology, cultural psychology, etc.), anthropology, criminology, etc.

I am not a sociologist per main formation, but sociology definitely has real-life applications and its knowledge-base can be used to (better) understand our surrounding society, even at a local level. For example, to understand [how parents deal with gender norms and gender expression](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0891243205284276?casa_token=6MYdNR_lTN8AAAAA:e-FO81j-qEuHGY4qBfTghU-ljchkxSR9S6BFXgaMUlqC_0lu_XfHTNx1TFcyqTVy4LXq-VewM2yxRiA), and presumably there are parents in your area to which you could apply these observations (or contrast with). The sociology behind toy selection is another obvious example, just [take a catalogue of boy toys and girl toys and see the differences in both categorization and advertising](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00288044.pdf). And this is just gender, what about the sociology of race?

Or going beyond gender and race, what about work and performance and the increase in diagnoses for mental illnesses? Even Ehrenberg's book *La fatigue d'être soi* (the weariness of self) on what the evolution of the concept of depression (from a sociological rather than psychological perspective) tells us about society has interesting points that can be applied to our contemporary surroundings, such as how more individualism has also chained us with more responsibility, which makes people tumble under the pressure of the ""cult of performance"". You might disagree, but I think it is not controversial to note how common this theme is in fiction, which tells us something about how people view the world and what kind of issues the public relates with (and presumably your local area has members of this public).

"Was just reading a meta-analysis on this today, actually! [Others can find that paper here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06292-0.pdf)

""Fewer women than men pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics
(STEM), despite girls outperforming boys at school in the relevant subjects. According to the
‘variability hypothesis’, this over-representation of males is driven by gender differences in
variance; greater male variability leads to greater numbers of men who exceed the performance
threshold. Here, we use recent meta-analytic advances to compare gender differences
in academic grades from over 1.6 million students. In line with previous studies we find strong
evidence for lower variation among girls than boys, and of higher average grades for girls.
However, the gender differences in both mean and variance of grades are smaller in STEM
than non-STEM subjects, suggesting that greater variability is insufficient to explain male
over-representation in STEM. Simulations of these differences suggest the top 10% of a class
contains equal numbers of girls and boys in STEM, but more girls in non-STEM subjects.""

Which suggests that there is a gender difference in variability of general academic performance, but that difference is greater in non-STEM vs. STEM fields, which is the opposite of the current demographics. Thus something else is contributing to the overrepresentation of men in STEM fields (the ""leaky pipeline"" is a common alternative explanation). 

Note that this doesn't address the related question that is also discussed ocassionally - is there a gender difference in IQ variability? Academic grades is likely a downstream, indirect measure of intelligence, with interactions from things like social support, learning environment, etc. But IQ is also not the greatest indicator of ""intelligence.""

The households were given discounts on rice and then bought less--demonstrating the positive relation between price and quantity demanded that violates the law of demand.

"&gt; ... concept of the business cycle.

This is not true. It was discussed by Ricardo. By the 1840s and 1850s Samuel Jones Loyd had quite a sophisticated theory about how disturbances in the gold standard caused crises. He wrote a good description of the business cycle in 1857:

&gt; ""It revolves apparently in an established cycle.  First we find it in a state of quiescence, - nexy improvement, - growing confidency, - prosperity, - excitement, - overtrading, - convulsion, - pressure, - stagnation, - distress, - ending again in quiescence.""

It's wrong to think that Marx is about business cycles.

&gt; Classical political economists could not identify that cyclical downturns in the capitalist system were actually inherent to capitalism itself...

Cyclical downturns have nothing to do with the ""Crisis of Capitalism"" that Marx discusses. In Marx the crisis is much larger, it heralds the end of Capitalism.

"So... You're saying that owners need to be paid otherwise they'd stop being owners? What kind of sense does that even make? If the landlord has no need for the house he should be *inventivized* to sell it. He has no need for it! Plenty of homeless people would want it! By demand and supply, since we now have more empty houses than homeless people in most cities, all of those houses would be sold instantly, with diminishing returns up to 1$ for the last house. No more houses would be produced because there is no financial incentive, but since we have *too many houses* that's capitalism working as intended... Right?

But that's not what happens, because people need houses to live so we can stockpile the resources and essentially blackmail them instead. I am not paying my landlord to wait on something I would want him to do anyway. Sell the goddamn houses already! He is the one stockpiling precious resources and charging a premium for their use. Way to remove the existing systemic violence in favor of a poetic rendition of rational self interest.

You are arguing that we need a return on investment in order to make capital investments. That is only true with a profit motive. Consider a cooperative that is deciding on whether to expand: if there is no profit motive, the decision is made based on costs and benefits. Do we get something valuable from the expansion? Will it allow us to make better products, reach more people, produce more efficiently, work less, create something beautiful? Does it have a purpose? Is the time investment and the labour that goes into this thing worth the effect it has? (preemptive note: lack of profit motive is not the same and does not require lack of monetary systems - it is possible to make it so that increased profit is less desirable than societal contributions for example, and it is also possible to tie the two together)

So in essence your argument is a tautology: if you take it for granted that everyone wants to make the most profit, then it is essential to reward expenditures with additional long term profit, and therefore capital gains are inescapable. But if, for example, the state is budgeting for most social benefits, then return on investment is not as important as the effects the investment has. The state has no need to worry about limiting its spending as long as the overall net result is better (the cap is not solvency, it is inflation and unemployment), and thus it has no profit motive, as money is irrelevant to it.

"&gt;They had no control group

This is a common take, and what it amounts to saying is that Hypatia, Gender Place &amp; Studies, Affilia, and the other journals which published accepted their papers are garbage, the rest of academia is garbage too so that's supposed to make it okay. Affilia published a paper which was a substantial rewrite of ""Mein Kampf"", only with ""Jews"" replaced with other feminist buzzwords. ""Sociology of Race and Ethnicity"" rejected a different rewrite of ""Mein Kampf"", which had ""Jews"" replaced with ""whites"". So props to that journal. Though the peer reviews were very favorable so I have no idea why it was rejected, maybe the editors caught on to the plagiarism.

I agree with you it would be good to have these types of controlled attacks on major journals to for better comparison. What we need is more of this stuff, not less. I recall seeing something that said they tried publish in more respectable social science journals, the kind the actually publish experiments are observational studies which involve data, but were uniformly rejected (unfortunately I can't seem to find the source of that again). 

&gt;It's just a high effort version of Lindsay and Boghossian's previous  attempt where they submitted an article multiple times and ended up  publishing it in a predatory pay-to-play journal

So what you're saying is these academics listened to other peoples feedback and improved their methods as a result? Yeesh, what a bunch of assholes /s. You are correct the previous version of this hoax was fatally flawed, because the journal they submitted to was predatory pay-to-publish garbage in the first place *and everybody already knew that*. These journals are *not* pay-to-publish, they claim to represent the modern humanities, and that claim appears to be true. But nobody wants to admit that they're garbage.

&gt;They haven't yet learnt enough to stop embarrassing themselves. This is unwarranted arrogance masquerading as science.

Funny, that's exactly how I would describe the entire contents of ""Journal of Poetry Therapy"" the allegedly scientific ""journal"" which published ""Moon Meetings and the Meaning of Sisterhood: A Poetic Portrayal of Lived Feminist Spirituality"" without any revisions.

E: Maybe I'll just explain the word. Say you'd like to know whether the length of the day inlfuences the temperature.

You come up with the result that longer days are correlated with higher termperature. Once could conlcude now that length of day directly influences temperature, but of course that's not the case. Instead, in summer, the position of the sun in relation to this particular spot of the earth results in both a rise in temperature and in longer days.

"To answer appropriately, I believe it is best to [define the keywords](https://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/sexuality-definitions.pdf). Generally speaking, in the social sciences:

* **Sex** is a biological classification as male, female or intersex. It is most often assigned at birth and is associated with biological indicators such as reproductive organs (penis, vagina). Sex as defined is ***biological*** and determined by genetics, hormones, etc. (for simplicity I am putting aside sex reassignment).
* **Gender** refers to the collection of traits and characteristics that a given society (culture) associates with a certain sex. Gender is a ***social construct***, because it encapsulates the societal expectations of what a ""male"" or ""female"" person is in terms of behaviors and appearance. It is not biologically determined that a woman wears heels and skirts, and that men wear ties and pants. What it *means* to be male or female, associated attitudes, etc. can differ through time and space.
* This is related to **gender expression,** which is how an individual expresses their gender, such as acting effeminate/masculine or dressing more or less effeminately. Perception and evaluation of gender expression depends on how different genders are conceptualized. For example, skirts were part of male fashion in the past, thus a man wearing a skirt in the past was conform to the male gender, whereas today they would be considered non-conformist (putting aside, say a Scottish man wearing a kilt).
* **Gender identity** is how an individual perceives themselves as male, female or something else. Transgenderism arises when there is **gender dysphoria**, as in the distressing feeling of incongruity between one's gender identity and biological sex.

The case of David Reimer does not contradict the current understanding of these concepts. He was born biologically male, but his genitals were mutilated and he was ""assigned"" female and raised as such. Then he went through something akin to gender dysphoria. Just like transgender people cannot be ""convinced"" that they are their assigned sex even when they are raised and live according to their biological sex, Reimer couldn't be ""convinced"" that he was female.

"&gt;He hired the workers, and the middle managers

Merely putting capital into motion does not create surplus value.  You seem to have missed Marx's entire point.  This is the subject of nearly an entire chapter.  A capitalist can put into motion $1000, but if they end up with $1000, no surplus is produced.  Though the capitalist might have been the one to set his capital into motion, clearly, they are back where they started.

&gt;coordinated the activities of workers so that stores of wool are well stocked and available to be spun

The capitalist does not necessarily do this.  They employ managerial labor, other labor-powers to manage supply chains, etc.

&gt;In any event, even If just his managerial staff are to get paid for the value they've created, where is that money coming from

That money is the variable capital initially advanced to employ them.  They recreate the value of their labor-power in the production process as well as beyond that, creating surplus value.  They are paid for the creation of surplus value, but they reproduce the original value of their labor power.

Mike is paid $100, but if he only reproduces a value of $100, there is no surplus.  Mike must produce above the amount required to reproduce his labor-power.  He is not paid the surplus.

&gt;All the surplus value is assigned to the men who are actually creating commodities.

"I would point out that the other user commented on how misleading it is to cut-off graphs in a manner to *only* show a decrease in average temperatures by not taking a big enough snapshot and by strategically beginning and ending at the 'right' moments. That is a correct statement, *regardless* of whether or not a more honest graphical representation would be enough to support anthropogenic climate change. It is still something to be wary about.

&amp;#x200B;

In any case, I am not an expert of the natural sciences, but I would assume that the published scientists making up the consensus about the human factor in climate change have taken into consideration whatever nuance is needed to agree about the man-made aspects over whatever reasonable alternative hypothesis experts needed to rule out.

[Multiple organizations](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/306/5702/1686.full.pdf?casa_token=lcbIQb3kES0AAAAA:JPQcjEblBBAtUub6DSkKMoA3sBpAKZPJn7h0nPHFlKUbLPMT4REYIYf-CXObf_hl5jdY1rtdqj3qKA) have affirmed this consensus:

&gt;The scientific consensus is clearly expressed in the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \[...\] IPCC is not alone in its conclusions. In recent years, all major scientific bodies in the United States whose members’ expertise bears directly on the matter have issued similar statements. For example, the National Academy of Sciences \[...\] The American Meteorological Society, the American Geophysical Union, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) all have issued statements in recent years concluding that the evidence for human modification of climate is compelling.

This consensus has been confirmed by several researchers, several times, on different journals.

[Example 1:](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2009EO030002)

&gt;In our survey, the most specialized and knowledgeable respondents (with regard to climate change) are those who listed climate science as their area of expertise and who also have published more than 50% of their recent peer-reviewed papers on the subject of climate change (79 individuals in total). Of these specialists, 96.2% (76 of 79) answered “risen” to question 1 and 97.4% (75 of 77) answered yes to question 2 \[...\] The two areas of expertise in the survey with the smallest percentage of participants answering yes to question 2 were economic geology with 47% (48 of 103) and meteorology with 64% (23 of 36). It seems that the debate on the authenticity of global warming and the role played by human activity is largely nonexistent among those who understand the nuances and scientific basis of long-term climate processes.

[Example 2:](http://www.pnas.org/content/107/27/12107)

&gt;The \[unconvinced by evidence\] group comprises only 2% of the top 50 climate researchers as ranked by expertise (number of climate publications), 3% of researchers of the top 100, and 2.5% of the top 200, excluding researchers present in both groups (Materials and Methods). This result closely agrees with expert surveys, indicating that ≈97% of self-identified actively publishing climate scientists agree with the tenets of \[anthropogenic climate change\].

[Example 3:](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024;)

&gt;The number of papers rejecting \[anthropogenic global warming (AGW)\] is a miniscule proportion of the published research, with the percentage slightly decreasing over time. Among papers expressing a position on AGW, an overwhelming percentage (97.2% based on self-ratings, 97.1% based on abstract ratings) endorses the scientific consensus on AGW.

You can choose who to trust more, the more or less 97% of experts who agree about the human impact, or the 3% who claim to be unconvinced, as per what I stated earlier in reply to how do we ""know"" things (by the cumulative effort of scientists researching and publishing papers of all sorts, which are the basis for the above articles).

I have taken the time to collect these articles (I will not be discussing climate change further) as they are also useful/pertinent because they point out the issue of communication and how the public might have a strongly skewed perception of what science as a whole states about a certain topic, which is where the uncertainty you talk about comes from.

"&gt;Everything can be quantified. Everything can be described in numbers.  
&gt;  
&gt;EVERYTHING.

Not all research questions call for quantification. Just because you can count something doesn't mean describing its qualities are useless or bullshit. Reducing qualitative data to the binary code used to create computer text does not answer qualitative questions, and the fact that you think quantifying data that way will give a meaningful answer to a qualitative question is laughable and demonstrates your ignorance of qualitative methodology.

&gt;Qualitative data isn't data, because it hasn't been quantified, so it has no value.

Qualitative data isn't quantitative data, but it is data. That's why it's called ""qualitative data"" (which you did, in fact, just call it). Data is not synonymous with ""countable,"" it refers to information that is able to be analyzed. Qualitative data is analyzed using several different methods.

&gt;Value by definition is mathematical.

Uhh, you do realize there are several meanings of the word ""value,"" right? Qualitative data has value because it has utility and worth, though of course it does not have numerical value.

&gt;If you cannot define the metric space between data points, if you cannot describe it topologically in the same frame of reference as other data points, no meaningful information about the relationship of such data can be stated nor derived. 

Upon what do you base this claim? How do you determine what counts as ""meaningful information""? That is a value (in the philosophical sense, not the quantitative sense) judgment on your part. What you do not see as meaningful can be meaningful to others (which is, despite your apparent disdain for it, why qualitative research programs continue to be funded and carried out all over the planet).

&gt;The issue is that people like you just aren't very good at math, and don't know how to quantify your data. This makes analysis impossible.

"Weber's Protestant Ethic as tied to capitalism has been empirically challenged. You can google any number of studies which show that his theory doesn't hold true or isn't explanatory; places which developed capitalism early often were not Protestant and Protestant places often did not develop capitalism sooner than other Protestant places which did.

Calvinist places also did not develop capitalism sooner than others. Switzerland, bastion of Calvinism, was not exactly on the cutting edge of industrialization for quite a long time. England, home of Anglicanism, is conventionally seen as the birthplace of capitalism as both an economic and social order, and England wasn't impressively tolerant of religious dissent by today's standards either.

It's worth remembering that the Hanseatic League developed production for sale on the market (as opposed for production for personal use, supplemented by production for the market, which was the prevailing model for most of the medieval period) beginning in the 1200-1300s. The Italian city-states invented precursors of today's banks. Arabs were doing capital-intensive trading with India based on forms of limited liability trading by 1500. Why capitalism as both an economic and social order developed in Europe is still a hotly-debated topic, and Weber's theory is not among the prime arguments anymore. The conventional wisdom seems now to be related to a version of the VoC argument, namely that the political fragmentation of Europe made possible the creation of multiple types of government orders, some of which (in an evolutionary sense) proved more fit at creating capitalism than others. Hence the Hansa, which is in itself a product of the bizarre governance structure of the Holy Roman Empire, which allowed city-states to experiment with government types including republicanism and oligarchy while enjoying the protection of the Holy Roman Emperor.

Anyway I wouldn't get hung up on Calvinism vs Lutheranism as they impact Weber's Protestant Ethic theory, because his Protestant Ethic theory is seen more as an interesting concept than as something which can be empirically proven. The facts just don't support it; the Calvinist position that God must be rewarding those with money, on the tautological argument that, because God is in charge of everything and those with money must therefore have it because God wants them to, is more an interesting piece of talking-at-the-bar theology than it is a convincing political economic theory. Weber's theory isn't taken all that seriously, and is just something that people in the history of economic thought should know.

"I know that Marx obviously wasn't writing about business cycles from the perspective of a modern central banker who is trying to best think about how to manage depressions.

"Can I piggyback on your thoughtful response.

Those critics who say that this kind of thing could never happen in the ""hard"" sciences are being disingenuous. There is a huge problem of bullshit academia and fake peer reviewed journals and conferences because of the publish-or-perish pressures you described.

It's also not for me or anyone else to say that whole disciplines shouldn't exist, which is a highly political censoring of academic freedom. A lot of my work is interdisciplinary, and I've heard numerous comments such as *why does x need a whole journal?* Well that's what's wonderful about diversity in academic thought - if enough people are interested in a topic, then they have freedom to explore ideas in that topic to their heart's content.

Additionally, peer review is not supposed to be fraud detection. When I review an article, I assume that the author is not intentionally trying to deceive me with fabricated data or intentionally bogus arguments. I put a lot of thought into offering authors constructive feedback, but it is premised on good faith on their part.

Furthermore, there is some mistaken idea that work that makes it through the peer review process is Truth with a capital T. That's simply not the case. Just because something is published doesn't mean scholars in that field need to think highly of the work. What matters more is how influential a paper is to further scholarship. Many things that get published never get cited - a collective shrug. The peer review is not supposed to be some arbiter of truth but rather it ensures some minimum competency on the part of authors in terms of argumentation, logical consistency, methodological rigor, and appropriateness of an article for a given field of scholarship.

In sum, I want to echo your opening comment:

&gt; We should do that regardless of what this article claims. We should always be doing that. As you note, this kind of thing is not unique to social sciences or humanities. I don't think anyone has claimed that this should have happened or that the system is working just fine. The problems people are raising are that the claims the authors of the article are making are huge overreaches not warranted by their ""data"" and that there are significant problems with their approach (which, yes, is about ethics but so much more).

I entirely agree with you. Just like with the replication movement, it is easy for the public (and even researchers) to view the problem as isolated to the field getting focused on. Any statement implying that this is unique to the humanities is unsupported given the design of ""study"" these authors did. However, we also can't exactly generalize this beyond the humanities given that they did select only the humanities work. Needless to say, if people were interested in this issue being examined in other fields we would need to agree it is worthwhile  and that doesn't seem to be the case (emphasis on ethics and the limited potential benefits). 

I think that one of the more troubling things about this recent set of papers is that the bad actors came from a different field in a politicized attack. I mentioned Walter Mischel's critique of personality psychology, he wrote it in good faith to improve the field he was dedicated to. The replication projects were heavily spurred by social psychologists trying to improve the methodology of our field because we want the work to be the best it can be. It seems that the three authors of these hoax papers weren't hoping to accomplish a strengthening of a field, but instead seeking some level of fame and a bit of a ""gotcha"" moment. 

&gt; Why is this indicative of poor theorizing instead of differences in interpretation of data about complex phenomena? Should all of the literature all agree with each other? I fail to see how this is a problem indicative of what you're attributing it to.

I also certainly agree that it is difficult to explain the complexity of human behavior. I wouldn't say this is indicative of poor theorizing, but I do think it is indicative of young theories that need to be more fully defined as time goes on. A need for more work that pits theories against one another, draws lines as to when and where certain theories apply, and makes it clear where there is a lack of consensus. In the areas of research that I work heavily in, there are a handful of reviews a decade that come close to doing this adequately and hundreds of papers that individually make bold claims with a small asterisk at the end in the form of a limitations section. As time goes on, consensus is established as science is ""self-correcting"". However, many authors emphasize their theory of choice and I think that leads to a possible misinterpretation of certainty for readers. As scholars familiar with the field we might be aware of competing theories, but the press releases, abstracts, and even the discussions frequently convey more certainty. I mentioned this because I think this allows for the crafting of a cherry picked introduction that supports an author's point and ignores the rest. The majority of readers will not be familiar with all of the dissenting theories and papers that were omitted accidentally or intentionally.

&gt; I'm unfamiliar with personality psychology, but we certainly don't have a lack of ""defined theory"" in anthropology and sociology, unless I'm misunderstanding what you mean by that. We have pretty clearly defined schools of theory which have their strengths and weaknesses. They're just toolkits for trying to explain data, so different theoretical frames will result in different explanations for social phenomena. Is that a bad thing in your view?

By no means was I intending to imply that we have no defined theories in personality psychology. There just tend to be many theories with almost identical frameworks and slightly different jargon that people find themselves subscribing to (in addition to the handful of very different big schools). One of my majors was sociology and while I agree the schools are pretty clearly defined I also think that human behavior poses a challenge of accurately summarizing when multiple of those schools can be used to define the exact same behavior and data. This can certainly be taken care of by creating studies that rule out the other theories, but my experience in sociology as well as psychology makes me think that sort of methodology is less common. I do not inherently think this is a bad thing, but it is problematic when a framework is broad enough that people can make it work for anything from straight up fraud or hoaxes to a poorly written paper with bad methodology. I do agree that theories are just toolkits though.

More directly, we can infer that homecomings do benefit the perception of the military as a whole due to their promotion by [pro-military publications](https://www.military.com/undertheradar/2017/11/celebrate-veterans-day-20-top-military-homecoming-videos-youtube).

In a way, they also promote a positive association not dissimilar to Eastern Bloc [cult of personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_personality) practices. For example, there are a very high number of examples of USSR and DPRK deplicting the subject of the propaganda surrounded by a vast number of healthy and happy citizens, looking upon the Great Leader with respect and love. If we substitute a specific leader with something more symbolic (the generic man in the grey military fatigues of the U.S. Forces), we could assume that they would similarly boost public perception of the military.

It's also worth noting that the perception of homecoming may be different depending on the nature of the war. *Prisoners of War, Prisoners of Peace: Captivity, Homecoming and Memory in World War II* notes that the reactions to returning POWs was markedly different by nation: 

&gt;British and American soviets were unequivocal, the returning POWs were heroes, but this did not apply to all victorious powers. Thus in France, POWs were not afforded the same heroic status as this went to the members of the *resistance*. The situation in West Germany was more complicated, and not only because they lost the war. In 1918 the Germans had lost the war too, but the returning POWs had been welcomed as heroes nonetheless. This time, however, the Germans were fully aware they had not been cheated out of victory, but had been comprehensively defeated. Thus although the relatives rejoiced when the POWs came home, they were not seen as victors but as losers. Only with time did this image begin to change.

"There's not any good evidence that the answer is anything other than ""all are the same"".

The reason is that the way these sorts of things are quantified are often quite selective. So for example you could make a case that written Chinese is more difficult to pick up as a native Mandarin learning child than written Italian as a native Italian learning child, based on the age at which school children become proficient at certain tasks, but that's only looking at one fairly minor part of the language.

For actually speaking, there has not been any convincing argument made within Linguistics for any language to be inherently more difficult for native learners to acquire. If anything, consensus is that all are equivalent.

A major reason for this is that two requirements must be more or less held in balance for a language to remain in regular use. One is that it must be complex enough to get the job done, and the other is that it can't remain so complex that it's needlessly cumbersome. When languages simplify in one area, such as for example sounds merge in the phonology, they always become more complex in some other area to accommodate. Otherwise too much ambiguity is introduced and the language would not be functional any more. In the example of simplifying phonologies, a common way languages accommodate is development of tone systems. Happened with Tai (Thai), Burmese, Chinese, Vietnamese etc. It's happening with some Korean dialects as well since around the 1950s as sounds like ㅂ and ㅃ merge in terms of articulation, but differ in pitch.

Take away the notion of formalised literary registers of a language that the average speaker never uses, e.g. the way two humanities professors might discuss their field in, and all languages are really basically the same. That's the default view that's more or less taken for granted in the field of Linguistics based on the complexity/change issue I just described, witnessed across areas (syntax, lexicon, phonology, semantics etc) throughout the world's languages.

Arguments that certain languages are objectively much more complex than others aren't being made by actual linguistics, but rather armchair linguists who are full of opinions about language but rarely actually have the background to make the claim, nor the data/methodology to back it up.

You're welcome to post on r/linguistics as well (I'm a mod there). Just be wary of rampant speculation + opinion masquerading as fact from armchair 'experts', as is always the case when asking about linguistics stuff on popular internet forums. You'll get more of it there than here only because r/linguistics is pretty big these days.

"Assuming that you are asking “do Chinese investors buy a lot of US real estate properties?” then the answer is yes. American real estate companies like Berkshire Hathaway have been working to sell real estate to Chinese investors for years. This is considered a safer investment than Chinese real estate largely because taxes, especially in the U.S. are super favorable to real estate investment holdings. In fact, if you hold a real estate investment that you are leasing out, you can actually deduct “depreciation” on the building even if that building is increasing in value (this is one of the main ways that Trump and his son-in-law both allegedly avoid paying any taxes).  American real estate is also a great investment for Chinese investors because it’s insulated from government asset seizure (which the government of China is known to do from time to time). 

Giving you exact numbers on proportionality of foreign investment in US real estate is going to be horribly difficult, for the very same reason that this phenomenon exists: people who invest in American real estate often do so through a series of shell corporations largely incorporated in overseas locations. Even Americans looking to launder money (see Paul Manafort) will use this system to hide their money. It’s incredibly difficult even for the CIA and FBI to trace these money lines because they will have to walk in to an office in the Virgin Islands or Cayman Islands or Ireland  in order to get any information and usually these investments are several levels deep.

So, to answer your question without answering it. Yes, there is a phenomenon of Chinese investors inflating real estate prices in the US by buying a lot of property. However, there’s not a precise answer about the proportionality of this relative to other popular investors like wealthy Americans looking to repatriate wealth through shell corporations or Latin American cartel lords looking to invest their illegitimate earnings in Manhattan real estate to clean them, or a Taiwanese President looking to clean up some bribes and protect them from seizure (https://www.npr.org/2016/06/16/482362934/when-dirty-money-becomes-luxury-real-estate). If you can find an easy, precise answer to this question, then the forensic accountants in the U.S. intelligence agencies would love to give you a job.

"Good grief, I linked to an article which references Kliman's efforts (and another which points out no one had previously done it for Adam Smith, and proceeding to correct that deficit). I also pointed out that economics is a bogus discipline from the perspective of many Marxists. But he is still an important influence on economists, notably Post-Keynesians.

"Link to the empirical evidence then

I think I figured out what Marxists do:

1. Take models they don't understand and ""critique"" their misunderstandings in a nonrigorous way in blog posts and other long winded drivel, neglecting to test them in a proper empirical way because they lack the technical ability to do so

2. Accuse economists of not testing their models when in fact they do so continuously, and accuse them of rejecting evidence that shows traditional models are incorrect (even though the incentive in any science, including economics, is to prove conventional wisdom wrong and learn new things, which is how all the big economists become well known)

3. While doing the above, Marxists will refuse to state their own ideas in a model capable of being empirically tested, do not submit it for peer review (or do so in their own circlejerk journals) and reject evidence against their ideas (which is perhaps not much, because again, they generally refuse to submit themselves to creating a testable, clearly stated model)",NA,FALSE,NA,"zzzzz94",NA,NA,1540473952,"t5_2sml9","t3_9r8v0k","t1_e8f8xwa",4,1541446826,1,0,"e8f9su5","AskSocialScience",NA,NA,NA

"&gt;On the other hand, I understand that his objection was rooted on neurology and biological/neurological explanations, rather than ""the content of the mind"".

But the problem there would be that behaviorists are interested in the neuroscience and biology of how the brain (and thus behavior) work. 

Skinner did make an argument that the study of behavior does not require neuroscientific explanations in order to be scientific, but the claim wasn't dismissing neuroscience but rather just establishing behavioural research as a valid level of analysis. In other words, while physics underpins chemistry and it can add important data to it, you can still scientifically study chemistry by itself. 

&gt;I do find it puzzling to suggest that there is little difference between cognitivism and behaviorism (at least in the past). I would suggest that behaviorism as is understood stresses learning through external stimuli and consequences, with a focus on observable and measurable outcomes, whereas cognitivism stresses learning through mental mechanisms, with a focus on internal structures and processes.

Both behaviorism and cognitivism focus on observable and measurable outcomes, and both can utilise mental mechanisms to explain behavior. 

There's a good article on the topic [here](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/what-happened-to-behaviorism).

&gt;Likewise, I would suggest that the cognitive revolution did change much and that the American school of psychology was strongly influenced, if not dominated, by the notion of ignoring mental content, whereas the cognitive revolution revitalized the study of what goes on ""inside"". It might be that, as I stated earlier, Skinner was misunderstood and that other behaviorists would argue against this depiction of the history of psychology re: behaviorism and cognitivism, I will take note of that and keep it in mind.

Yeah that's the point I'd make - the cognitive revolution was a repackaging of radical behaviorism, largely caused I think by Chomky's misrepresentation.

"The most evident difference between the two examples is that the former was associated to a different social group of higher status and rejected based on group identity (differences in values, ideology, etc.) while the latter was exclusive because of accessibility and price rather than rooted in group identity.

Based on the above reading, I would suggest that Tajfel (social identity theory) and Turner's (self-categorization theory) [social identity approach](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dominic_Abrams/publication/226768706_An_Introduction_to_the_Social_Identity_Approach/links/56b4910108ae22962fe5fca9/An-Introduction-to-the-Social-Identity-Approach.pdf) and, in general, psychological research in group dynamics allows to explain the phenomenon.

Members of a group share a social identity, which is associated to their self-esteem. People need to keep a positive self-esteem and to distinguish themselves from others. By defining themselves as ""les sans-culottes"", it can be argued that these people were distancing themselves as much as possible from the other social group (the ""elite"") and I would assume it was also associated with positive values (we who do not wear *les culottes* are better because of XYZ, it symbolizes fraternity or whatever). I would assume the same cannot be said of Jell-O.

"&gt;Is there any hope?

I would suggest that one of the basis of social sciences concerned with people's behavior (sociology, psychology, criminology, etc.) is that it is possible to prevent, reduce or eliminate negative behaviors, symptoms, etc. that are distressing and harmful for the self and for society by figuring out the causes, otherwise these would purely be descriptive endeavors, whereas there is an interest for practical applications.

Fundamentally speaking, I turn towards how Swiss experts have engaged the introduction of [internment for life for ""dangerous and violent"" offenders](https://www.revmed.ch/RMS/2007/RMS-125/32582). According to this law, it is possible to condemn an offender who has been evaluated by psychiatrists as *incurable* and incapable to be corrected to be locked away forever without fixing periodic reexaminations (unlike ""normal"" internment which can still effectively last a lifetime). it has never been applied, because as [Dr. Gravier explains](https://www.letemps.ch/suisse/bruno-gravier-crime-nest-une-maladie), it is not scientific to make a lifetime prognosis and affirm that a person can never be cured in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;For example, how effective could therapy be in treating mental  disorders, and how much can we ever hope to change, with the temporary  use of medication?  
&gt;  
&gt;Furthermore, what can we hope to change for someone with Borderline personality disorder, and/or depression?

As there *are* people who get better after treatment, or offenders who are rehabilitated after intervention, then it means that people can suffer less from their maladies, change trajectories or be cured.

Both [psychotherapy and medication can be effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3683266/) at reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. [CBT ""is highly effective for](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrew_Butler6/publication/303383381_The_empirical_status_of_cognitive-behavioral_therapy_A_review_of_meta-analyses/links/5a8031bbaca272a73768d3da/The-empirical-status-of-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-A-review-of-meta-analyses.pdf) adult unipolar depression, adolescent unipolar depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, social phobia, PTSD, and childhood depressive and anxiety disorders"" and there are ""\[m\]oderate effect sizes (M=0.62, SD=0.11) were obtained when CT was compared to controls for marital distress, anger, childhood somatic disorders, and several chronic pain variables (i.e., pain expression behavior, activity level, social role functioning and cognitive coping and appraisal)."" Research forges forward, there is still space to create better models and better understand these disorders, and to develop better interventions. [Citing Andreasen](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/brave-new-brain-9780195167283?cc=pt&amp;lang=en&amp;):

&gt;The short-term goal for those of us actively engaged in mental illness research is to understand the causes so that we can find better treatments. The long-term goal is to figure out how strike early and prevent at least some of them from occurring at all.The goal of the twenty-first century is to find a ""penicillin for mental illness.""We would like to fight schizophrenia or dementia as effectively as we can currently fight infectious diseases such as neurosyphilis or pneumonia. We hope to discover a brave new world in which mental illnesses, now painfully common, become infrequent and easily treated.

&amp;#x200B;

Likewise, [Martison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Martinson) might have famously asserted that *Nothing Works* for criminal rehabilitation, but since then there is a wealth of literature on *What Works*, such as Andrews and Bonta's [model of Risk-Need-Responsivity](http://www.courtinnovation.org/sites/default/files/documents/RNRModelForOffenderAssessmentAndRehabilitation.pdf), such that ""if  a  treatment  intervention  begins  to  adhere  to  one  of  the  principles  we  start  to  see  reductions  in  recidivism and  when  all  three  principles  are  evident  in  a  rehabilitation  program  then  we  see  average  recidivism differences  between  the  treated  and  non-treated  offenders of 17% when delivered in residential/custodial settings and 35% when delivered in community settings. Treatment can work in residential and custodial settings but effectiveness is maximized when the treatment is in a community setting.""

On that same topic, I will conclude with the concept of [desistance from crime](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-0245-0_15) in response to the general question of change. It is a well observed phenomenon in criminology that most offenders are not lifetime offenders, but tend to desist from crime during adulthood. This change is ""associated with some of the social and situational changes \[..\] At the same time, desistance also appears to be related to internal changes. The desisting ex-offender often makes the claim that “I am not the same person that I was when I committed those crimes,” and of course all of us are aware of undergoing internal changes over time in our own lives."". These changes include, for example, identity transformation and ""\[a\]t least partially, this process involves reworking an individual’s self-narrative or story"". Desistance approaches to rehabilitation strive to encourage these changes and make juvenile offenders desist from crime earlier, and there is promise in this field.",NA,FALSE,NA,"Revue_of_Zero",NA,NA,1540052232,"t5_2sml9","t3_9pqyqu","t3_9pqyqu",6,1541266024,0,0,"e84izsh","AskSocialScience",NA,NA,NA
"Plenty of landlords lose money trying to manage rentals.

Similarly, renting out a home is not necessarily a guaranteed high rate of return; the double digit growth in housing prices we've been seeing in certain major cities is historically quite unusual, and unsustainable.  Housing prices are levelling off right now, and it wouldn't surprise me if they outright crash in the near future. 
 Simply renting out the home you've bought is not always a realistic option, especially if you just recently bought and the housing market goes down.  A *ton* of people who bought in the leadup to the 2008 crash found that out, and lost everything they'd invested.

Even once you're stable, a single tenant who's going through a rough time can wipe out *years* worth of profit.  They lose their job, refuse to leave, need to go through the entire eviction process (3-6 months in some states).  People getting evicted tend to damage the house (sometimes just out of neglect, sometimes out of spite), so a ton of work is involved in getting it back in habitual condition after they're gone.

"My personal highlights from the academics' post: 

&gt;""This problem is most easily summarized as an overarching (almost or fully sacralized) belief that many common features of experience and society are socially constructed. These constructions are seen as being nearly entirely dependent upon power dynamics between groups of people, often dictated by sex, race, or sexual or gender identification. All kinds of things accepted as having a basis in reality due to evidence are instead believed to have been created by the intentional and unintentional machinations of powerful groups in order to maintain power over marginalized ones. This worldview produces a moral imperative to dismantle these constructions.""

Later on,

&gt;Underlying these alleged “social constructions” is the most deeply concerning of them all. This is the belief that in urgent need of “disrupting” is the simple truth that science itself—along with our best methods of data-gathering, statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, falsifying, and replicating results—is generally a better way of determining information about the objective reality of any observable phenomenon than are non-scientific, traditional, cultural, religious, ideological, or magical approaches. That is, for grievance studies scholars, science itself and the scientific method are deeply problematic, if not outright racist and sexist, and need to be remade to forward grievance-based identitarian politics over the impartial pursuit of truth. These same issues are also extended to the “Western” philosophical tradition which they find problematic because it favors reason to emotion, rigor to solipsism, and logic to revelation.

I think these criticisms are spot on. These fields often seem more interested in pursuing a morally-based mission not to find truth or discuss it, but instead to ""disrupt"" the existing field by accusing it of failing to take seriously the claims of whichever group the academic has identified as marginalized and is now championing.

"Thank you I appreciate the well thought out response.

Please correct me if I am wrong, but it sounds like the David Reimer case more or less disuades the idea that our gender expression and how we identify with our gender is purely a result of how we are raised, but more of a complex interaction of our biology and our environment.  So while men aren't born wearing plain T-shirts and short hair (these are things we observe from other men) there may be a biological drive to identify with these expressions and dress based on our environment.

Further, it sounds like we keep Gender as a social construct to include people who are not born biologically male, but associate with being a man (or visa versa) such as Transmen.  They learn from their environment to be a man - it isn't born - but that doesn't mean they aren't naturally born with a disposition to learn how to be a man from their environment even though they are biologically female.

"This is a *huge* topic with vast bodies of literature. You will not get a sufficiently deep and nuanced answer on reddit because these are questions about complex and messy topics that we, to put it bluntly, still have a lot to learn about. You are right to question claims about gender that circulate around, and I encourage you to keep researching and reading widely and broadly on this topic regardless of whatever answers you get here. This should be a starting point rather than an end point for these answers.

That being said, here's some (overly simplistic) answers to your questions.

First, it will help to delimit some different aspects of gender. These divisions are not uncontested, but they are as good a starting place as any. Gender can be thought of as consisting of at least the following:

* Gender roles - the social roles people inhabit that are expected for a particular gender in a given society (e.g., ""mother"" and ""father"" are gender roles)
* Gender identity - the individual sense of self one develops as a particular gender (e.g., one's sense of being a ""(cisgender/transgender) man"" or ""(cisgender/transgender) woman"" or ""non-binary"" are gender identities)
* Gender expression - the ways individuals express their gender identities/roles through behaviors, adornments, discourses, etc. (e.g., wearing make-up to express one's ""feminine"" side if make-up is associated with feminine gender in their society)

In Euroamerican societies, sexual orientation is certainly linked to gender (after all, the ""homo"" part of homosexual refers to gender), but sexual orientation is most often an identity category, since there are people who identify as straight but engage in same-sex sexual behaviors. So, we can think of sexual orientation as one aspect of gender identity in this way. (People will disagree with this explanation, of course, especially if they want to reduce sexual orientation to the brain or attraction or whatever, but human sexuality is too complex to reduce in that way.)

""Sex"" is the term we use to describe the biophysiological aspects of the body as ""male"" or female"" that include hormones, chromosomes, secondary sex traits, genitals and gonads, and so on. When you see people say that sex is a social construct, they are referring to the fact that we use ""sex"" to socially categorize bodies according to biological traits, not that the biological traits themselves are constructed, though this leads me to another issue.

You are right to point out how separating ""sex"" and ""gender"" creates problems. We (social scientists) do this as an *analytical tool* to help explain various phenomena. However, in reality the two are mutually interdependent because *humans are biocultural animals*. In humans, biological and sociocultural traits/environments are always already influencing the other. Our biology is shaped by both our physical and social environments, just as social life is shaped by biological traits. Always be suspicious of any claims that reduce anything related to sex/gender to either the purely biological or purely social (in my experience, I find the former is much more common than the latter). This is why it's super complicated, because we have these behaviors or traits that are biocultural but our current language sort of restricts us to talking about them as *either* biological *or* sociocultural, usually implicitly. All of those things I've listed above--gender roles, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, and sex--are all complex amalgamations of sociocultural and biological phenomena.

These topics are also highly politically charged, so talking about, for example, gender roles and bringing biology into it is highly fraught because biology has been used historically to keep people situated in hierarchical social positions (e.g., to keep women in lower social positions by claiming that it is ""natural"" for women to stay at home and not work because of their biology). Much of the work on such topics today is demonstrating just how much social life shapes biological processes; for example, we can see this pretty clearly in health and medicine in how [legalizing same-sex marriage led to better health outcomes](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2017.0502) or [how changes in American immigration policy since Trump became president have impacted birth outcomes among Latina immigrants](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28115577). These are just two examples of the complex interactions of social life and biology that spring to mind from recent news, but there's large bodies of literature on this (and similarly for race and health).

Let me be very clear here: I am not advocating for a biologically-reductionist view of sex/gender nor do I believe that biology has significantly higher influence over sex/gender than social life. I think it's complicated and these processes are dynamic and evolving.

Finally, oppression on the basis of sex/gender can happen regardless of whether there is a binary gender system in place or some other multi-gender system in place. I think a binary system is necessarily more oppressive because it restricts acceptable/recognizeable genders to two categories, and even if those categories are huge and no one really fits into one perfectly (as is the case in Euroamerican societies), it's still restrictive in that it only makes those two categories socially legible. That being said, that does not automatically mean a multi-gender system or a non-gendered system (if such a thing is even possible) could not still be oppressive, they'd just be oppressive in different ways. Abolishing ""the gender system"" (whatever that is) would not necessarily abolish oppression, since there's myriad axes by which people are oppressed and marginalized.",NA,FALSE,NA,"anthrowill","Medical Anthropology",NA,1540055197,"t5_2sml9","t3_9puvlp","t3_9puvlp",23,1541267531,0,0,"e84m6t2","AskSocialScience",NA,NA,"anthro"

"""Hard science"" isn't really the term I would use. I much prefer the term ""natural science,"" and it's a separation that makes sense in the traditional 'grouping' of the sciences in Western educational tradition. 

&amp;#x200B;

Within that, you broadly categorize scientific disciplines in one of three categories: Social science, natural science, and the humanities. This, I feel, clarifies the discussion a lot more, and ultimately a lot of it boils down to the fact that the three of them have very different methodologies and very different ideals for what the ultimate purpose of science even is. 

&amp;#x200B;

German philosopher and sociologist Jürgen Habermas divided the sciences into what he called 'human interests,' and noted that the natural sciences tend to have a very technical interest. They want to disseminate the natural world to find out how it functions, and to that end they use a model based on empiricism. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason for the distinction between ""hard science"" and ""soft science"" has less to do with whether or not one is more 'scientific' than the other.

"For whatever its worth there's a school of though regarding writing called ""affective practice."" Usually its designed as a way to get younger kids - say middle school - exciting about writing by softening the stance on the ""rules"" and focusing more on the content.

To create an example out of thin air suppose Shakespeare's middle school writing teacher had seen him write:

""Whats in a name that witch we call a rose, bye, any other name would smell as suite""

and declared it ""bad writing"" and ""wrong"" because it has some misspellings and grammatical errors? Writing as affective practice essentially states that we should be a lot more concerned about the content and the meaning as opposed to the ""rules."" I've always thought about this concept in regards to creative writing but you could apply the same principle to an academic journal as well. Is the content of the research and the conclusion of the research invalidated by run on sentences or poor grammar? No, not really.

Obviously one should try to pay attention to the rules but less than perfect rule following in exchange for extraordinarily compelling content isn't without merit.

I doubt it. At least to the point of them thinking about it this hard. Like a lot of things in life ""the rules"" often become less important.

Do you go five or ten miles over the speed limit? Do any of these things in and of themselves make you a ""bad driver?"" No. They don't.

That said you should know the rules of the road just like you should know the rules of writing but those rules are fluid.

"Full disclosure: I’m a social scientist by training with a focus on social and personality psychology. I’m also jaded about the field and very pro-open science. 

To me the take away from those sources is “just like we can’t build rules around the bad actors regarding outright fraudulent data, we can’t take these criticisms to heart because they stepped outside of the ethics of research.” I think that’s fair. The YouTube video did a good job stating that it would be a massive burden on the peer review process if we had to assume all data was false or incorrectly analyzed.

However, I also think that the fact that some of these papers even made it past an editor, received reviews and requests for revision, and some were actually published (even if they are in low tier journals) speaks to an issue I’ve taken with current state of the social sciences and how we write and read introductions. I think that we can still accept that this shouldn’t have occurred and that we should reflect on current practices to see what we can improve. Here are a few of my own thoughts that I do not think are limited to the social sciences:

In researching for my dissertation, I found countless papers incorrectly summarizing the work of other authors. It became pretty clear to me that introductions end up a long game of telephone where the actual work can be pretty misconstrued. The inability for editors and reviewers to not immediately discard these papers by non-experts as nonsensical or misrepresentations of the field either means that the authors are actually pretty great academics, our jobs are actually pretty easy, or the review process is too trusting of a statement followed by a citation. I think we can do better. 

The authors describe themselves as making statements and then searching for literature to cite. Although a poor practice, I think this happens to some extent. At a minimum, people are only searching certain terms or scholars they have heard of. Anything printed in a foreign language is immediately out. We are building our theoretical frame works on pretty limited scopes and these authors were able to exploit that. Although they are bad actors, that doesn’t mean that there isn’t a lessor problem that should be addressed.

My last thought is that our theories are unfortunately so vague and all encompassing that they are easy to manipulate. In some fields, there are such defined principles that reviewers are easily able to say that a new idea (or new result) is absurd. In the social sciences we seem to have small theories or conditions for everything and can easily explain away or accept things at our whim. In one of my projects I found work saying that we do x more than y and other work saying it’s y more than x, entire bodies of literature were arguing the exact opposite of one another and calling it different things. The lack of defined theory appears to have been pretty easy to exploit for these authors even if they did get lucky with one paper and find themselves in the middle of a new debate.

"Social constructivism looks at how something is created socially. This idea has a foothold in blank slate as that is required for social constructivism to be all encompassing. If the blank slate is not a real phenomenon then social constructivism has less effect.

&gt; [Social constructivism emphasises that all cognitive functions including learning are dependent on interactions with others \(e.g. teachers, peers, and parents\).](http://www.psy.gla.ac.uk/~steve/courses/archive/CERE12-13-safari-archive/topic3/webarchive-index.html)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructivism

Behaviorism is just a study of impulses. It's a very narrow field in psychology. It can be based on inborn impulses or some theory of a blank slate or a theory of constructed impulses. Often it's studied by people who do believe in evolution and natural selection and do think impulses are something that is inborn and not created socially. But often they will want to study how to change behavior. That's at least what many of the most popular scientists did in this area.

&gt; [Behaviorism \(or behaviourism\) is a systematic approach to understanding the behavior of humans and other animals. It assumes that all behaviors are either reflexes produced by a response to certain stimuli in the environment, or a consequence of that individual's history, including especially reinforcement and punishment, together with the individual's current motivational state and controlling stimuli. Although behaviorists generally accept the important role of inheritance in determining behavior, they focus primarily on environmental factors.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism)

Yes, I was remiss not to have put bisexuality in the OP.  And the added factor of gender fluidity, which the source I cited states is ""not the same as bisexuality"" (but seems to be similar).

Do we have any idea what percentage of the population is bisexual?  I imagine in some instances the orientation is subdued.

And, (per sexual fluidity link I cited) ""if someone identifies as heterosexual but then finds themselves in an environment with only people of the same gender,"" then ""they might feel increased sexual or romantic attraction"", if that is the case, might the same happen to a woman who is in a mixed gender setting but has repeat abusive encounters with men over time?

"The implicit question here is ""what should economy try to answer to?"". In your answer, it's a given: economy is about distribution. That's mainly the neoclassical perspective. If this is your view on economics, Marx is unconfortable because he comes up with different questions, which grants him different perspectives on how to read and define economics.

Your answer is pretty much ""LTV doesn't work"". Let's agree. Regardless, and I reistate my point, him having a critized point in his theory is not ground for absolute disqualifying. If that was the case, we wouldn't have any reading material on economics. LTV is not the only important point in marxian economics, although I'm not going to delve into it mainly because english isn't my first language, but it's really telling that with him taking a piece is calling it shambles, when we've done that very thing with every ""classical"" economist.

"I'd say your question veered straight into philosophy there, like how can you know what you know, and can you really know something? At a certain point you either live in utter uncertainty, which is not very functional, or place some degree of trust in the scientific community and that its processes and mechanisms allow to reduce falsities as much as possible. Majority does not mean correct, but between deciding to trust the consensus of experts and trusting a few individuals, I'd rather give the benefit of the doubt to the consensus, while keeping an open and critical mind. Not unlike how it is said that democracy is the worst form of government, except for all others.

Another argument that can be made is that for exceptional claims, there needs to be corresponding evidence. I would extend that to controversial positions taken by the minority, especially if it is a small minority. I recognize that there have been pivotal moments in the history of science where the individual was correct (e.g. Semmelweis). But that isn't a recurring event.  I would also be more cautious when it is hard to distinguish scientific arguments from the politically motivated ones.

Still, for a [case like Wakefield](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3136032/), it has been demonstrated that he deliberated committed fraud and acted for corporate interests, thus unless you decide to go into the rabbit hole of conspiracies, I would apply Occam's razor - he was an unethical researcher, and he faked facts for money, rather than the victim of a worldwide scientific conspiracy paid by Big Pharma.

"&gt;You think I don't understand what qualitative data are, and I don't think you know what quantitative data are. 

What, exactly, have I said that makes you think I don't know what quantitative data are? I use both qual and quant data myself.

*You* are the person who has been making arguments that ""qualitative data aren't data"" and ""qualitative data is bullshit."" Quantitative data is extremely useful for certain kinds of research questions, and qualitative data is useful for other kinds. I am not the one trying to say that one kind of data isn't useful.

&gt; You mentioned ethics and æsthetics, two classical branches of philosophy. Specifically, they are the sub-branches of [axiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiology), the study of value. Go ahead and read the first two paragraphs of that article. I'm not the first person to suggest that formal axiology involves mathematical rigor.

I'm sorry, you want me to look at a *Wikipedia page* that has one sentence mentioning someone's work applying formal logic to ethics and aesthetics as evidence that everything you've said about qualitative data is somehow right? Because a philosopher used formal logic to think about and try to quantify ethics? Did you even click through and read the entry on [value theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_theory)? Or [value (ethics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(ethics))? Did you look at any other websites, like the [SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/value-theory/)? Are you about to try to pull a Sam Harris and tell me that ethical judgments of value can be determined through quantitative data?

If you want to find common ground, how about you first acknowledge that your definition of value as necessarily mathematical is too narrow and that other definitions exist? How about you acknowledge that things like social values exist that aren't derived from mathematical formulas or formal logic?

&gt;So let's engage in a cooperative exercise, to demonstrate good faith to each other. You give me an example of an ethical or æsthetic value, and I'll attempt to fomalize it into a quantitative expression. 

I already gave you one in my previous comment. You aren't reading comments in their entirety, are you? How are we to engage in a good faith ""cooperative exercise"" if you don't even read my comments in full?

Unless you acknowledge my previous points about the definition of value, there's really no point in continuing because you will have failed to exhibit good faith.

"Thanks for clarifying, craft specialization is something I can say a bit about.

A big thing to know is the difference between a ""craft specialist"" and ""craft specialization"". A specialist is someone who has a skill in a certain area. This could be someone who is good at weaving, or someone who is good at building shelter, or any other of the myriad possibilities. Craft specialization, on the other hand, is when a specialist derives most or all of their livelihood from their craft. An example would be if that weaver sold cloth or was employed to make it, or if that builder was employed by a state or made a living themselves. It's important to note that craft specialists came before craft specialization.

The difficulty in answering the rest of your question is that it's very broad, and across that breadth it varies greatly. The value of knowledge itself differs across the world, so some societies shared a lot of knowledge, whereas others kept it restricted. Hunter-gathering societies tend to be more egalitarian than sedentary agriculturalists, so it's more likely that knowledge was shared openly. That being said, the specific person in a group who was good at building might have kept their specific knowledge to themselves to ensure their importance, and that's not something that could be easily seen in the archaeological record.

As u/toysmith suggested, narrowing your question would help in answering it. Looking at a specific region would go a long way toward finding the answers you're looking for. To that extent, here are a couple readings I hope could be helpful:

"&gt;Okay, I've explained this perfectly. You just don't understand math well enough to follow me. 

Hahaha! You haven't even used any math, all you've done is play word games.

&gt;I defy you to describe how something is valued without using numbers, or comparing variables. 

See, this is a great example of your word games. You have narrowly defined ""value"" to necessarily require numbers, so anything I say in response about ethics or aesthetics will automatically be dismissed as not actually being about value. You have refused to acknowledge that there are different definitions of ""value"" that do not involve numbers. Personal preferences are values in the philosophical sense and do not require quantification. For example, I value ice cream because I like the taste. See? No numbers or ""comparing variables"" necessary.

But let me guess, you will want to define ""variable"" in a non-mathematical sense in order to play the ""gotcha"" game? Or you will make up some of your own variables and apply them to my simple statement of value and then claim those numbers are the ""true meaning"" of the statement?

"I wouldn't define self-fulfilling prophecy as being a social constructivist theory or idea. I would however direct you to [labelling theory](https://leeclarke.com/courses/intro/readings/becker_definingdeviance.pdf), which relies on mechanisms such as self-fulfilling prophecy. As Becker explains, deviance is created by social groups which define certain behaviors as deviant via rules and laws which are applied to particular people labelled as deviants or *outsiders*. Following that, the stigmatized person adheres to the label, uses it to justify or explain their own behavior, etc. And if you add ostracization and all the social consequences of stigmatization, the label ('prophecy') fulfills itself.

Backing up a bit, crime in general can be read through a social constructivist perspective. Crime in of itself does not exist in nature, it's a social fact, and what is or is not perceived as criminal depends on society. Crime serves to define what is allowed or not allowed. Ever so often relevant Durkheim explains how crime serves a function in society and how 'normal' crime is in his book *The Rules of Sociological Method*.

It is also interesting to compare how street criminals are perceived versus white-collar criminals. The archetype of a criminal is the burglar and the thug, not the defrauding banker who can cause much greater damage to society (see the financial crisis of 2007-2008) and the manner in which each is dealt with is notably different.

"Loads. Kliman is probably the most prominent at the moment (and his work would lead you to others). But (depending on your purposes) this is a useful health warning: [Zombie Marx](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2011/07/zombie-marx/)

&gt;But in each generation, there are others who have defended an “orthodox” Marxian economics as a separate and superior paradigm, which can only be contaminated by absorbing ideas from elsewhere. The pugnacious Andrew Kliman, for example, opens his Reclaiming Marx’s Capital with the line “The economists have changed Marx, in various ways; the point is to interpret him — correctly.” Accordingly, he unabashedly spends a chapter on hermeneutic method, and the book is devoted to proving the internal logical consistency of a method for transforming the values of Volume I into the production prices of Volume III. This, at least, is more sophisticated than what we might call Frankenstein Marx — the stitching together of an argument from authority by stringing together famous quotations torn out of context. Criticizing Frankenstein Marxism is like campaigning for motherhood and apple pie — no one will disagree.

&gt;What I call Zombie Marx is different — the reanimation of a corpse which still holds organically together in some way. This is the reconstruction of Marxist economics as a coherent body of thought, not a collection of quotations. That this work is dogmatic is not my complaint. As Thomas Kuhn suggested in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, a little dogmatism is important to most science, maintaining the coherence of a community of researchers and organizing its research agenda. Mainstream academic economics is very dogmatic about its theoretical core — methodological individualism and the general equilibrium apparatus. It is unfair to single out Marxists. Rather, it is scholasticism that is the problem — the need to ground everything in a 140-year-old text. It would be wrong to say that the likes of Kliman are dogmatic in the sense that they demand unthinking acceptance of everything in Capital — it is obviously a lot of intellectual hard work to “interpret Marx correctly.” It cannot be taken for granted that Marx was right; it must be proven anew with each generation, against both rival interpretations and the revisions the previous generation had found necessary to make.

That's not to say Kliman isn't good, he's very good, and he's doing exactly the sort of work you're looking for. Just bear in mind that the monetary system has changed twice since Marx was writing (and one of the causes of the crash was neoclassical economics ignoring the financial system). So depending on what sorts of answers you're looking for, you should make sure you understand the inevitable limitations.

"&gt; Your landlord is providing maintenance on the home, appliances, landscaping, and other upkeep tasks. He is also taking on the risk of the home being damaged or destroyed, the risk of you cancelling your lease and the home being vacant, etc.

"Let's recap the argument so far.

I said that landlords are still inherently exploitative without LTV since they do not contribute anything to society, yet are paid (thus, exploitation). Key part of this claim is that their profit is enforced through indirect threat of violence and undemocratic means. If you substitute landlords with zero profit financial aid programs from the government, this problem disappears even if the programs are financed with a return on investment to compensate for government risk (though I would argue that the government can handle that risk without even asking for any roi, but theoretically it is possible to argue that a small roi is necessary to evenly compensate both parties). I don't think I made this consideration sufficiently clear, but it is the reason I insisted so much with ""things that are wrong in the world"" - those things are the direct consequence of the way this system is structured.

You argued that the landlord *does* contribute something to society, because they could sell their apartment instead of renting. They need to be compensated for their investment, otherwise they would consume.

I argued three things:

1) that there is no need to provide an incentive towards investment and propensity to consumption is grossly overstated

2) that the specific situation with landlords (and the job market) changes substantially the situation compared to a general investment strategy due to the material conditions of necessities under capitalism

3) that there is a marked difference between a return on investment for personal profit and a return on investment for societal gains (including that the state doesn't need at all the former and can focus on the latter).

Re-reading this conversation it seems to me that you are focusing on the fact that every investment needs to have a return to be worth it, and not focusing on whether that return is in terms of extraction of financial surplus value from someone in a position of inferior power, or in terms of increased productivity and social welfare. Specifically, you argue that regardless of the economic system in place there is still a preference for consumption now rather than later and that in turn demands that people pay a premium for obtaining resources now from those that own them.

The second part is disputable, as it generates a system where the rich get richer by design. Still, that is not sufficient in itself to claim the system is inherently exploitative. The marxist exploitation emerges when you consider what this system enforces in practice - i.e. the exploitation of workers by owners thanks to wildly asymmetric power structures. It is arguable whether this is inherent in the system itself, or if it is just emergent behavior that is present in our society right now. Given that we lack any example of a society where this doesn't happen, my money is on the former, but this is not logically necessary. In short:

&gt; How do we differentiate between a co-op making a return on investment and an individual doing the same?

The coop redistributes the return on investment based on a democratic process involving every worker while the individual makes a tidy profit for themselves imposing their de facto tyrannical power on others through indirect threats of violence. This is exploitative, and the claim that this is inherent in our system comes from the above reasoning on power dynamics.

---

Why do we want to give a financial incentive in the form of return to investment to landlords instead of forcing them to sell everything on a competitive property market so that homeless people can get paid to buy a house? Why do we need to provide a *financial* return on investment instead of having none? Wouldn't the return of investment of ""having a fellow human with a house instead of without one"" be sufficient without the usury? Would it be sufficient for a benevolent state (or state-equivalent, but that's another matter) apparatus which can finance investments without needing any financial return, rather focusing on the material effects of that investment for society?

If the answer to the above is that nobody would invest, why are cooperative and state-based strategies of financing endeavours not sufficient to provide the investment funds necessary for economic activity? Isn't the only problem that a lack of aggregated capital creates a lack of liquidity? What about banking institutions in all of this?

The exploitation of workers by owners manifests itself due to the inherent asymmetry in the material conditions of the two classes. Why do you feel like the owner is taking on a risk, when the risk they are taking on is that of becoming a worker? Why do we want to reward the population that is already rich with additional profits due to their starting wealth? Are decisions about the redistribution of profit margins democratic in practice? Are decisions about how and what to invest taken based on what is best for the society as a whole or based on what best benefits the financial fortune of an individual?",NA,FALSE,NA,"TheMormegil92",NA,NA,1540825912,"t5_2sml9","t3_9r8v0k","t1_e8ntuyo",2,1541594185,0,0,"e8nznsj","AskSocialScience",NA,NA,NA

"Yes, literature on penal policies suggest that it has little to do with actual crime and a lot to do with different cultures and sociopolitical contexts. 

The history of different prison models itself reflects different ideologies, such as the [Pennsylvanian model](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pennsylvania-system) being based on religious concepts of expiation and penitence (which then would bring rehabilitation) and [Bentham's Panopticon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon) which was instead informed by utilitarian principles.

Moving on to actual policies. Michael Tonry has several papers summarizing the literature on the topic and analysing differences between America and the rest of the world: 

&gt;[The scale of the phenomenon is distinctly American](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0011128799045004001?casa_token=MM7jWkHiLxoAAAAA:LUk_frwETrr9WwhWZ9CDZwlqujVITg_qFCpa2DFFlf_JXxFJVDOSo3T4VrduSkaB7o68fZpyFFuZ). It arises partly from American moralism and partly from structural characteristics of American government that provide little insulation from emotions generated by moral panics and long-term cycles of tolerance and intolerance”. 

For example: 

&gt;Although politicians who attempt to win favour by demonstrating their toughness nearly always say that they are honouring citizens’ wishes, the evidence is that harping by politicians and the media on crime issues is what causes citizens to become concerned”.

Comparing North American and European punitive responses to crime to identify the [determinants of penal policies](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/518582), he found that:

&gt;Prominent risk factors include “conflict” political systems, elected judges and prosecutors, sensationalist journalism, Anglo-Saxon political cultures, and a populist view that criminal justice policy should be strongly influenced by public sentiment and partisan politics. Other comparative risk factors are relatively greater income inequality, relatively weaker social welfare systems, lower levels of trust in fellow citizens and government, and relatively lower levels of perceived legitimacy of legal institutions.  
&gt;  
&gt;Prominent protective factors include consensus political systems, nonpartisan judges and prosecutors, Francophonic political cultures, and a predominant view that criminal justice policy falls appropriately within the province of expert knowledge and professional experience.

"&gt;Are you serious? How could a credible economics program not require a course on the history of economic thought?

Yes, I'm serious. And I fully agree with you that it's ridiculous. I've met econ undergrads who are in their 3rd or 4th year of study and they've never encountered even the 2008 crash, other than as anecdotes told by the professor. If they haven't covered the most important economic event of their lifetimes, they definitely haven't covered Adam Smith or Mill.

Econ, as part of its attempt to be a 'hard science,' largely seems to believe that a quality education involves teaching its students the most up to date theories and methods. Previous theories and methods, which must have been proven incorrect by the fact that they're not mainstream, are therefore discarded. That's fine, the thinking goes, because economics is a hard science, and at some point those old ideas were disproven or supplanted by the scientific process.

"Thanks.  
So, if you want my opinion, this thing got old after the ""Sokal"" case. I think the authors are right in addressing what they call (i quote the second article) the ""problems with the peer review process and the ""publish-or-perish"" atmosphere at many schools"", but I find the attack of critical theory and cultural studies frankly annoying.  
I am myself not at all a fan of those branches of social sciences, but I personally think they have their validity and their function both in the academic environment and in the contemporary society. Addressing those fields as ""grievance studies"" in this way is in my opinion a straight out political and ""personal"" attack. And i would like to point out that I personally am extremely critic of those fields and their influence on ""left wing"" politics, but I don't think anyone should engage in such an operation of creating false papers and submitting them all around only to shake off some pebbles out their shoes, if you get what I mean.  
I think if someone published a paper on how ""dog owners were less likely to interfere when male dogs nonconsensually humped female dogs than other male dogs"", with a solid statistical base and decent methodology, well that could give some insights on how we see male-female relations and how we mirror our behavior in animals. I can see how that got published. We can then discuss on the ""usefulness"" of that research, but I think that could be done for a lot of the research conducted by people browsing this subreddit.  
The good news I think is that still a lot of those ""false papers"" got rejected. But in the end personally I think those authors come out worse than the journals they wanted to ""expose"".  
Moreover, I can't help but wonder on the usefulness of such a personal/political attack towards those research fields in the actual (us) political climate and overall approach towards gender-related issues.

"To be honest I would suggest studying social and cultural psychology and in the future branch out to the specific population of mentally ill people. Identity, attitudes, the individual in society, are topical themes of social psychology.

"You are welcome. My following answer is based on what I know about self-categorization and identity theories (e.g. Tajfel and Turner's research) and based upon [scientific papers such as this one](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-7988-9_25).

It is natural for humans to categorize themselves, and it is ""obvious"" to differentiate oneself from others based upon sexual characteristics, unless one is androgynous. As a defining characteristic, it is not surprising that biological sex is associated with the correspondent gender identity that is developed. Thus, if a person ""feels"" male, perceives themselves as male, it is not surprising that they will inclined to integrate the meaning of being male by observing other male people. Put this together with the fact that gender norms are everywhere in our society, since our birth - gender is defined since the beginning, e.g. what kind of clothes we wear as a baby, what toys they buy us, how they behave around us, how they call us, and so on, so forth.

In short, it can be said that ""gender is a collective category in which social influences build on biological differences between the genders to heighten gender differentiation"". Now, if someone for some reason (the causes of dysphoria are still an open question) have a discrepancy in how they perceive themselves as ""themselves"", then a conflict regarding identity, and a different development thereof, can be understood.

Thus, whereas many scholars would probably agree that gender identity development is associated to biology and environment, what it means to be a gender and its expression remain socially determined (as you say, we are not born with plain T-shirts and short hair). The biology is in how we self-categorize and search for similarities and dissimilarities in other to give sense to things, reduce uncertainty, et cetera.

Lastly, we do not ""keep"" gender as a social construct. Gender *is* a social construct, as explained above. There cannot be a predisposition to learn behaviors that change and have changed throughout history and geographical space, it does not make much sense to suggest that there is a tendency to like blue rather than pink because of our biology (blue having been a feminine color and pink a masculine color in the past).",NA,FALSE,NA,"Revue_of_Zero",NA,NA,1539804560,"t5_2sml9","t3_9p0371","t1_e7y76ze",4,1541162065,0,0,"e7ycefb","AskSocialScience",NA,NA,NA

&gt;Abstract: Professional lobbyists are among the most experienced, knowledgeable, and strategic actors one can find in the everyday practice of politics. Nonetheless, their behavioral patterns often appear anomalous when viewed in the light of existing theories. We revisit these anomalies in search of an alternative theory. We model lobbying not as exchange (vote buying) or persuasion (informative signaling) but as a form of legislative subsidy—a matching grant of policy information, political intelligence, and legislative labor to the enterprises of strategically selected legislators. The proximate political objective of this strategy is not to change legislators' minds but to assist natural allies in achieving their own, coincident objectives. The theory is simple in form, realistic in its principal assumptions, and counterintuitive in its main implications. Empirically, the model renders otherwise anomalous regularities comprehensible and predictable. In a later section, we briefly bring preferences back in, examining the important but relatively uncommon conditions under which preference-centered lobbying should occur.

"Contemporary economics PhD programs and research are pretty orthogonal to politics. Sure, there are policy prescriptions, but these aren't even the majority of economics research, and almost none of a PhD student's training. I'm going to be lazy here and say you should just read any standard grad micro or macro text. I recommend Mas-Colell, Whiston, &amp; Green for micro, and Ljungvist &amp; Sargent for macro. You'll see that what few assumptions there are, are very robust (e.g. preference relations are consistent), and the rest is just math. Depending on how you define bias, either your standard PhD training has very minimal bias, since most of it is rigorously supported even by the standards of hard sciences, or it categorically cannot be biased since it's not even discussing anything ideological.

I also want to dispel the idea that economics as a field leans ""neoliberal"". A lot of orthodox, well-regarded economists work with planned economies, and they don't make any use of Marxist thought. It's simply either irrelevant or outdated, even in the economics of communism.

"I will mostly comment on the criminology aspect of the question, and then make some comments about the 'normalization' aspect of the paraphilia.

To begin with, as I stated earlier, I am not aware of 'lolicon' and 'shotacon' pornography being specifically researched by those interested in the topic of pornography in general. I assume that there exist Japanese scholars that study and/or have studied the subject, and that language barriers make them unknown beyond the country's borders. It seems to me that it is kept as a skeleton in the closet and that when it is publicy debated, it is on legal basis regarding, for example, freedom of expression, thought policing, or whether fictional drawings directly harm children and/or require protections.

&amp;#x200B;

According to [Galbraith](http://www.imageandnarrative.be/index.php/imagenarrative/article/view/127), ""Takatsuki Yasushi points out that sexual abuse of minors was statistically much more common in Japan in the 1960s and 1970s, and has actually been decreasing since, which roughly coincides with the increasing presence of fictional lolicon (Takatsuki 2010: 258-262)"". The primary source in Japanese, so I cannot evaluate the claim. This older article by [Diamond and Uchiyama](https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=179581) seems to reach the same conclusion, suggesting that the proliferation and availability of pornography in Japan, including materials with characters that ""may be adults, children, or both, and \[that\] can be in manga as well as in adult reading materials"", coincided with decreases in sexual abuse.

This observation can be applied generally, as the accessibility of pornography has increased with the Internet, while crime trends have been declining. While it is worthwhile to observe, caution is needed regarding interpretations: this does not by itself mean that pornography (whichever kind) reduces offences of the sexual kind. For sexual crimes, there is also an issue with using official statistics ([an illustration](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yumi_Suzuki/publication/314648770_Child_sexual_abuse_in_Japan_A_systematic_review_and_future_directions/links/59f87e940f7e9b553ec0b235/Child-sexual-abuse-in-Japan-A-systematic-review-and-future-directions.pdf?origin=publication_detail) for the Japanese case).

That said, while the general literature on the relationship between pornography and sexual abuse has some mixed results, to my knowledge it tends to [suggest that the former does not cause the latter](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.695.3973&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf). Likewise, the research on the link between consuming child pornography (not virtual) and child abuse has mixed results, but there is [reason to suggest that child pornography alone does not contribute to actually committing abuse](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-244X-9-43). Some scholars have [suggested the potential value of allowing access to virtual pronography](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Milton_Diamond/publication/49644341_Pornography_and_Sex_Crimes_in_the_Czech_Republic/links/09e415111ced447bf5000000/Pornography-and-Sex-Crimes-in-the-Czech-Republic.pdf) to reduce the risk.

&amp;#x200B;

Concerning ""normalization"": arguments can be made, and have been made, that the desires of 'lolicons' are not necessarily for real-life children and/or abusing actual children. But empirically, it is a question to be researched quantitatively, besides of qualitatively. And concerning causality, although the causes of pedophilia remain an open question, there is research suggesting that pedophilia has both an early age onset and neurobiological causes, which do not give much reason to expect that something like 'lolicon/shotacon hentai' can ""increase pedophilia"", as in make people develop an attraction for children.

In any case, if we take into account [Galbraith's papers](https://duke.academia.edu/PatrickWGalbraith) about Japan in relation to 'Otaku' culture and in regard to 'Lolicon', plus recent trends such as the [recent criminalization of possession of child pornography in Japan](https://edition.cnn.com/2014/06/17/world/asia/japan-child-porn-law/index.html), I do not think that there is reason to suggest that the existence and proliferation of 'lolicon/shotacon' pornography makes pedophilia more socially acceptable. Not in Japan, at least, and not for actual child sexual abuse. This consideration is informed also by the progress in awareness and legislation against sexual abuse (in general in the Western world) and decreasing tolerance for these crimes, even though porn is arguably much more available today than decades ago. To the best of my knowledge, Japan stigmatizes pedophilia (the paraphilia, but also acting on related urges) like in the Western world.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, (more) research on the specific topic would be needed to have concrete/better answers on the specific topic of (Japanese) cartoon child pornography. Taking into account some older studies and general considerations about pornography, I would tend to expect that 'lolicon/shotacon' pornography does not (alone) contribute to increasing cases of actual sexual abuse of real-life children. Likewise, I would not expect this kind of pornography to increase the percentage of pedophiles (as in people that are sexually attracted to children) or reduce their stigma. I strongly doubt that it contributes to making child abuse socially acceptable.",NA,FALSE,NA,"Revue_of_Zero",NA,NA,1540379037,"t5_2sml9","t3_9qpwwz","t3_9qpwwz",8,1541403276,0,0,"e8col8a","AskSocialScience",NA,NA,NA

"Your question needs a bit of refinement. 

First, it’s not clear what you mean by the “era before specialization occurred.” Trivially, humans have specialized their labor since the invention of agriculture. I *think* you mean a more formal codification of specialty like craft/artisan guilds, correct? If so, you should also specify the era you mean as well as the culture (Europe? China?).  

So a rewording of your question (if I’m inferring your intent correctly) might be: *what do we know about the constraints and affordances for sharing specialized {craft name} craft knowledge in {region} before, during, and after the establishment of formal specialization?*

“Formal specialization” needs clarification. It can be as simple as a shared social recognition of someone’s expertise by simply naming it (“Joe’s a good blacksmith”), or something more structured (“Joe is a Master Blacksmith in the guild”).  I think this distinction will be critical for understanding how knowledge is shared. 

Also, my “before, during, and after” assumes some common agreement about said eras. Blacksmithing is a specialty, but one could argue the significance of guild membership has long since waned. Front-end web service design is right now a continually evolving specialty, etc.

If the orthodox framework is unable to explain the world, and even produces the steepest grow in inequality since the first industrial revolution, would you call that a success?

"To this I add a simple caveat about resources. A corporation that spans multiple states (or is, more often, international) can leverage all those profits via the campaign finance system to overwhelm local sources of campaign funds. A politician might have to canvass several thousand households and secure the maximum donation from each one in order to equal the donations that a single large corporation can afford to give a superPAC or some other political organization not subject to donation limits. 

So there's a resource mismatch between local campaign funding capacity and inter-state corporate profits, and then you also have to consider that state-level campaigns are far cheaper than federal. A $10k donation probably wouldn't President's policy stance, because they need to raise ~$1bn. However, a $10k donation in a race with total spending of $50k is significant.

"Not gonna lie wasn’t expecting a response as fiery as that, was just trying to explain my understanding of where history is in Modern Economics...I’ll try to respond adequately but am multi-tasking so no guarantees. 

First off just let me say I don’t disagree with most of your points, my area of interest is predominantly in behavioral Economics and there’s a significant amount of research from the 1980’s that’s been pretty much forgotten from my understanding. I’ve seen some people say it’s cause Economics is a “fast-paced” discipline but being unaware of its past is definitely a significant weakness of the field that should be addressed more. Personally Economics is a passion for me so I’ve read into the history of the field in my free time and I’d say the “fast-pace” has definitely left several interesting ideas in its dust. Tho imho the history would best be placed in 2nd or 3rd year undergrad over 1-2 courses, laying the ground works of the analytical frameworks(thinking in terms of ceterus paribus, scarcity, etc) should remain the predominate part of first year courses.

That being said I’d argue that Mathematical Economics does have its place in modern Economics, perhaps it shouldn’t be as over-represented as it is but there’s definitely a demand for it so to speak. While methods of historical analysis are definitely useful for advancing economic understanding they aren’t nearly as useful for providing the situational analysis that from my understanding provides most of the jobs in the field of Economics. Through quantifying the various aspects of a situation and what different choices represent Economics is able to more accurately inform various institutions about the material outcomes of their various courses of action. It allows them to determine what product will be most profitable, which road will allow the most people to access employment, etc. While the subjective outcomes are predominately left out of the situation(ignoring stuff around externalities) the quantification significantly increases the ability of Economists to identify an outcome that is at least materially the most beneficial. 

Of course please keep in mind I’m not saying it should dominate all of Economics, just that it has a purpose in the field. I do agree that other non-quantifiable perspectives shouldn’t be neglected as they currently are and that they can provide valuable insights.

Paragraph three: Pretty much on the ball, would definitely agree there needs to be a more diversified perspective drawing into Economic thought(tho tbh I’d still reckon there should be a split early on between political and mainstream(to maintain my jargon use), while they’re both addressing the same issues I’d say the foundations of the perspective are different so there should be a distinction. That being said no reason the two fields couldn’t at least partially be taught in the same courses and they definitely need a lot more interaction. More so a nit pick than anything else. On a bigger note, I’d argue that a return to the normative Economist isn’t necessarily justified but that’s more on an ideological standpoint. While like any good social scientist I like Technocracy(only a mild joke there...) I think ultimately any actions should reflect the morality and desires of the wider populace(there being lines of course(murder, genocide, etc)) and that it’s not the place for any single person or Economist to decide those things. Tho if you mean they should also inquire into moral and ethical implications I would agree, not 100% certain what you meant.

"To focus on the political side; conspiracy theories like this are weaponized in a way to fire up the conservative base. Politicians collect data to understand what their constituents want. This seems beneficial and perhaps innocuous, but with how much data they can collect, and how detailed of profiles of their voters they can create, it becomes supercharged. 


For example, there was a recent study that looked at the difference in brain structures between liberals and conservatives. Conservatives have slightly larger amygdales. Assuming people's brain structures define how they vote, you can generally tell how people will think with this knowledge. This article gives a few examples of this.
https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-human-beast/201210/why-liberal-hearts-bleed-and-conservatives-dont


I don't generally take a purely biological approach to these kinds of topics, but it is an interesting point considering these types of conspiracy theories are rarely (if ever, because I've never seen one) liberal leaning.

Given that politicians (not solely limited to those who run for office) likely know these things, they can use this information to fire up their constituents against opponents, feeding tidbits of information that they hope to catch on, for example, like the pizza-gate scandal.


In this way, Pedophilia is more like a weapon in an arsenal. Yet these types of issues are never black and white, they are very multidimensional. Although there are no single explanations, Religion and more specifically, Christianity and Protestantism represent a rather large monolith that can be used to explain both why the church as an institution is exempt from punishment and why Satanism is such a popular topic when used as a weapon. It is so engrained in our society, even our implementation of capitalism relies somewhat on it (Max Weber talked a bit about this in his seminal work Protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism).

"I agree with OP that the same scientific method is used in the social sciences and in the so-called hard sciences. In both areas, scientists formulate theories, derive hypotheses, and test them empirically. In both areas, theoretical models are simplifications of the complex reality and, thus, never predict everything with 100% correctness. In both areas, there is measurement error ([see Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_uncertainty)). In both areas, empirical research is complemented by philosphical discussions, e.g., of the nature of time and causality in physics and of the nature of happiness and well-being in Psychology. Thus, it is misleading to label only one of the two areas as ""hard"".

An actual difference between ""hard"" and social sciences is that the measurement error in the social sciences tends to be higher, because e.g. a person's intelligence is harder to quantify exactly than the Planck constant. A second difference is that the social sciences study humans, their culture, and their societies, whereas the ""hard"" sciences study the physical (chemical etc.) world. A third difference is that most laypersons readily admit that they don't know much about physics and chemistry, but everybody thinks that they are ""experts"" on how the human mind works, how societies function etc.. So there is a lot more pseudo-science by self-proclaimed experts in the social sciences than in the ""hard"" sciences, even though there is a great amount of physics-related pseudo-science as well (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscience)).",NA,FALSE,NA,"Raingood",NA,NA,1540279278,"t5_2sml9","t3_9qjxcn","t3_9qjxcn",7,1541362860,0,0,"e8aa1hd","AskSocialScience",NA,NA,NA

"These are not just weak points in the theory of value, these are points that are fundamentally incompatible with the study of economics.

"&gt;I just think you’re pulling from data outside the homeless population. The topic of conversation is homelessness not mental illness as a general concept.

Excuse me for not being clear in my approach - I was breaking down your question as you asked whether violence is more prevalent among the homeless, with the idea (hypothesis) that ""dual diagnosis of mental illness with substance abuse would be a leading factor"". Thus I briefly (as it's a large topic as can be seen elsewhere in this thread) touched upon mental illness, substance use and homelessness separately and together regarding violence, inflicted and suffered, to nuance the subject matter.

&gt;The rate of violent crime among the homeless population is forty times higher. which given what we know about metal illness and the homeless population suggests there is a direct correlation between metal illness and violent crime.

I would avoid simplifying it that much, as overrepresentation in statistics does not mean that a variable is the direct cause (or main cause) of a result, which is best illustrated by the misleading interpretations of criminal statistics divided by race. In short, a 'direct' correlation does not say or explain much on its own.

Assuming that your ""forty times higher"" refers to [Martell and colleagues' 1995 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7641002) that found that the ""rate of violent crimes was 40 times higher \[...\] in the homeless \[mentally ill\] population"" compared to domiciled mentally ill people, it is worthwhile to note that it wasn't about the general population of homeless people. I would also cite  their conclusion that ""the stress of homelessness increases the risk of criminal behavior"", which refers to the conditions of being homeless which might exacerbate symptoms (the nuance is important).

For a more recent study in the same city (New York) and the same kind of population (homeless people with mental illnesses), [Fischer and colleagues](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23423994_Homelessness_Mental_Illness_and_Criminal_Activity_Examining_Patterns_Over_Time) did also find a relationship between sheltered homeless people, severity of symptoms and violent crime, but they also underline how interpretation of these results is not as simple as that. Some excerpts from their discussion:

&gt;Those few individuals in the \[sheltered\] group who nevertheless experienced homelessness may have been characterized by higher levels of social and behavioral instability, which may have been accompanied by a greater propensity toward violent behavior.

And:

&gt;Again, it is worth noting that the likelihood of committing a violent crime increased within participants as they intermittently experienced sheltered homelessness. In other words, these findings suggest that homeless individuals are not inherently violent, but that some may become violent when exposed to temporary living situations such as shelters \[which might expose them, for example, to high levels of stress or to confrontational living conditions\] \[...\] these findings suggest that homeless individuals are not inherently violent, but that some may become violent when exposed to temporary living situations such as shelters

But for the topic of *homeless people in general*, [Speiglman and Green](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/193805.pdf), using data from the 1995 DUF national survey, found that homeless arrestees were less likely to be charged for a violent offense than housed arrestees, such that, for example, across 24 different sites (in different cities across the US), a total of 17.6% homeless people were arrested for violent crimes against 31.8% of homed people.

In conclusion, to the best of my knowledge, it is disingenuous to answer with a simple ""Yes, homeless people are more prone to violence"" or ""Yes, mentally ill homeless people are more prone to violence"", as it paints an incomplete picture about a heavily stigmatized and vulnerable population that is already prone to criminalization both by policy makers and the people.",NA,FALSE,NA,"Revue_of_Zero",NA,NA,1540199778,"t5_2sml9","t3_9q2b7e","t1_e87xrrp",2,1541327037,0,0,"e885lia","AskSocialScience",NA,NA,NA
"I definitely agree with your sentiments. I think the publication process needs to change dramatically. 

I think that moving to a living document format would be absolutely amazing. Why can’t the authors or students of authors in citing correct my misrepresentations of the work? Why can’t far superior statisticians point out error and inform me of how to fix them (or do it themselves) so that the estimates can be done correctly? Why can’t New publications that change the interpretation of my work be appended to my document for readers? The answer to all of these seems to be “well, that’s not how journals work” and “authorship would get confusing”.

I also agree that we don’t need to throw it all out. I think that we see knee jerk reactions historically and I’m terrified that the replication movement will end up being one. The biggest would arguably be Walter Mischel’s criticisms of personality psychology. He just wanted his own field to take methodology and measurement more seriously and instead he nearly killed it. 

There certainly needs to be a shift in the way replications are handled. Studies with poor methodology and minuscule sample sizes are held up as gospel because they are seminal works, but a rigorous replication with 99.99% power gets harsh criticism. Our text books need to reflect that the seminal ideas are great theories and perhaps just case studies and observations that led way to fields. However, I agree that by and large the stuff talked about in texts seems pretty solid.

"Source showing what? That conservatives are more religious? I'll oblige you again, even though it feels like you're wasting my time for the sake of it.

For starters, plenty of the ""moral panics"" of the last fifty years have been started in churches. The one that primarily comes to mind is the 90s fear of violent videogames and D&amp;D, that they promoted Satanism / Black magic, etc. These were perpetuated by fundamentalist Christian organizations and are an example of a satanic moral panic. 


Defending the original source, it mentions a couple of key factors that make it relevant. For one, a large amygdala predisposes someone to reactionary ""fear-based"" thinking. Fear-based thinking corresponds with involvement in religion, and participation in these moral panics. If I have to prove that fundamentalist Christian organizations are conservative I'm going to have to flip a table.


Generally this is not how discourse is handled. If you want to prove that liberals are equally as inclined to satanic panics, then be my guest and do the actual legwork required to refute my point. Coming in and doing the bare minimum necessary to participate in the discussion is not an appropriate level of involvement. I'm really only engaging with you in good faith, even though it seems as though you're really just here to talk about your feelings.

"As someone from the more ""pure"" sciences, I just want to rant a little bit about a frustration I have developed while talking to my friends in sociology/poli sci. Just because your field of study deals with more complex phenomenon (variables are harder to isolate), doesn't give you the right to abandon empirical methodologies and still call what you are doing science. In my field of study (neuroscience) we always look at the evidence first, develop a hypothesis as to why that evidence is arranged the way it is, then we create experiments to attempt to falsify our hypothesis, or even the theory in general. I get a feeling that even the very idea of falsification seems to be a very distant concept in socio/political sciences. For example my friends thesis topic was a Hegelian Dialectical analysis of power systems in municipal politics. His thesis was filled with obscure technical jargon, a variety of undefined variables, spanning multiple fields from psychology, climate science, poli sci and sociology. There was no empirical methods, no falsification and no experiments. It seemed to me like the paper was a really good attempt at disguising a list of simple tautologies in a complex looking web of obscure jargonisms, giving the appearance of a serious academic paper. Obviously I didn't tell him that because I value our friendship, but I nevertheless was left with an uncomfortable feeling in my gut. I'm not saying there isn't value in this type of work, rather I'm simply concerned that this type of work is considered scientific at all. 

Could someone re-assure me that maybe there is something scientific about this type of research? Or am I right that there is a growing segment of sociology and poli sci that have become un-scientific in their methodologies? Is this something I should be worried about?

"&gt;I think that we can still accept that this shouldn’t have occurred and that we should reflect on current practices to see what we can improve.

We should do that regardless of what this article claims. We should always be doing that. As you note, this kind of thing is not unique to social sciences or humanities. I don't think anyone has claimed that this *should* have happened or that the system is working just fine. The problems people are raising are that the claims the authors of the article are making are huge overreaches not warranted by their ""data"" and that there are significant problems with their approach (which, yes, is about ethics but so much more).

&gt;In the social sciences we seem to have small theories or conditions for everything and can easily explain away or accept things at our whim. In one of my projects I found work saying that we do x more than y and other work saying it’s y more than x, entire bodies of literature were arguing the exact opposite of one another and calling it different things.  

Why is this indicative of poor theorizing instead of differences in interpretation of data about complex phenomena? Should all of the literature all agree with each other? I fail to see how this is a problem indicative of what you're attributing it to.

&gt; The lack of defined theory appears to have been pretty easy to exploit for these authors even if they did get lucky with one paper and find themselves in the middle of a new debate.

I'm unfamiliar with personality psychology, but we certainly don't have a lack of ""defined theory"" in anthropology and sociology, unless I'm misunderstanding what you mean by that. We have pretty clearly defined schools of theory which have their strengths and weaknesses. They're just toolkits for trying to explain data, so different theoretical frames will result in different explanations for social phenomena. Is that a bad thing in your view?

"Financial economics, not macroeconomics. Different silo (in a discipline plagued by the existence of silos and bad ways of connecting them if they are connected at all).

This is not a controversial point in contemporary macro:

&gt;My second claim is that the exclusive focus on a microfoundations methodology seriously compromised the ability of the science to understand the Great Recession. Here I am very specific: mainstream macroeconomics ignored a clear property of the time series for aggregate consumption in the UK and US in a way that pre-NCCR methods would not have done. As a direct result, the importance of the financial sector was largely ignored before the global financial crisis. If pre-NCCR methods had not been trashed by mainstream macroeconomics, the discipline would have been in a far better shape to understand what happened during the Great Recession.

"&gt; how do we know these are externally valid?

The short answer? We don't entirely - Game Theory 101 is that in every game we set up we make assumptions, if those assumptions are wrong then we will get an internally coherent result that isn't externally valid.

That's why we try to use existing knowledge/theory to inform the assumptions of the game. Why does (nationally) popular policy not get passed? One reason is because we know incumbents care about re-election, and voting for x policy might not serve that end. From there we can reason out who might or might not support policy x. 

The problem for game theory is really that often human behavior isn't perfectly rational as demonstrated by behavioral economics, etc. That said, economic games can still be really valuable in understanding human behavior. For example, the prisoners dillema is an example of a non-cooperative game that has been very important in many fields.

"Broadly, this is a function of ""social regulation"". A good place to start would be Foucault's [Discipline and Punish](https://monoskop.org/images/4/43/Foucault_Michel_Discipline_and_Punish_The_Birth_of_the_Prison_1977_1995.pdf) - the original french is surveiller, as in surveil, and I think that captures the general sentiment better.  

Essentially, humans have a vested interest in controlling the behaviour of others through words and actions. Prime among these is the regulatory gaze. You can locate this pretty easily, by wearing a big pink fluffy hat in a public space. People will give you that look that tells you that you're not doing normal correctly. Similarly, failing to perform your gender, failing to keep on trend with fashion, or the cases you mentioned of deviance (drinking/partying) etc. are sites of social regulation. The rules differ by place and time. Masculinity in 17th century England is vastly different from 21st century England let alone 20th century Japan, Turkey etc.. Participating in the social ritual of regulating the behaviour of others with the gaze / laughing at people who are out of place, is a way of negatively constructing your own status as in the in-group. Bonds can be formed by outwardly, and often aggressively, regulating deviance. 

As societies get wealthier, and survival gets easier, they tend to develop [""post-material values""](http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199270125.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199270125-e-012), that prize independent thought and expression over conformity and order.

"I think the social science concept you should look into is ""essentializing"". It describes the idea that we can neatly attribute characteristics to separate categories, oftentimes reinforcing certain perceived differences. (Someone correct me if I'm wrong.) 

Anyway, by saying men are logical and women are emotional you're trying to find an order and a contrast in something that isn't there. The truth is that psychologically there is no difference. 

If there is any socially learned difference in use of logic and emotion it is still not a hard attribute of sex or gender. Rather, it is a question of personality. 

I think we can still have an interesting discussion on possible expectations of society for men to rely more on reason that on feelings (insofar this distinction exists at all) and vice versa for women. That does not necessarily mean men and women actually use reason and emotions differently.

However, when it comes to organizational decision making -- if we're aware of the kinds of bias' we're likely to fall victim to we can design support institutions which help us make more deliberative decisions.

"This is generally the case for a couple reasons:

1. The entire concept of America was to allow the citizens to have as much freedom as possible. In order to do this we regionalized our government in a way that gives these smaller sects more power so regions are individualized. Also, most federal politicians are in place to represent individual states. In other words, our country was designed so states could get away with more.

2. No body pays attention or reports on states within the media that a large portion of the country pays attention to, which is either national or international. Fox or CNN isn't going to report on Kansas because it normally isn't relevant to all of the viewers. Do note, a shooting isn't the same as state legislature. As for the local news, at least in my area, they don't report on politics too often, at least not on policy. Not saying that's bad, they have 30 minutes to get through the news so they have to pick and choose. A full thorough policy report could take hours. Policies that are reported on tend to have immediate effect on the citizens, like Medicare, traffic laws, etc. Usually they will provide a a link to a government website to further outline the details of the policy at hand, but how many people watching local news are competent with a computer?

So in short, it's generally easier to get away with corruption within the state, and because it's easier, corruption is more common.

We assume a good faith effort on the part of our colleagues, which is why this ""hoax"" was particularly stupid, because it uses those of us engaging in good faith efforts to improve scholarship to try to shit all over any social sciences and humanities that engage with critical studies of gender, race, and sexuality.

&gt;One of my majors was sociology and while I agree the schools are pretty clearly defined I also think that human behavior poses a challenge of accurately summarizing when multiple of those schools can be used to define the exact same behavior and data. 

Why is this a problem? Can social phenomena not have multiple potential explanations? I guess I'm struggling to see why multiple theoretical frameworks explaining the same phenomena in different ways is a problem.

&gt;I do not inherently think this is a bad thing, but it is problematic when a framework is broad enough that people can make it work for anything from straight up fraud or hoaxes to a poorly written paper with bad methodology. 

Why? What is the benefit of a very narrow framework? For example, how would a very limited theoretical framework be beneficial for explaining gender, sexual, and power dynamics? (Not to mention the authors really did not use Butler's performativity theory properly, which to me is a failure of peer review, not of Butler's framework.)

&gt;I do agree that theories are just toolkits though. Does it not bother you that vastly different theories can be used to explain the same behavior, study, and data? 

No, why should it? I appreciate that there is a diversity of approaches to explaining social life. I think that social phenomena often do not have a singular cause, so having multiple theoretical frameworks to explain (or interpret) them is useful. Of course, I favor some kinds of frameworks over others, but that's because I think they do a better job at explaining whatever it is I am studying. Those frameworks won't necessarily work in all contexts, and that's fine.

I do agree with you that people developing pet theories or dedicating themselves to a single theoretical approach can be problematic. Something I struggle with now is how pervasive Foucault is in medical anthropology. He's useful for explaining some stuff (like larger structural issues), but I don't find him useful at all for examining day-to-day interactions in clinical settings. I find myself having to push back a lot against reviewers and interlocutors who insist upon centering Foucaultian theory.

"Yes it is HK. Thanks for your suggestion. 

I am unable to get survey data due to lack of access and time. There are public data about it but it seems unreliable and inconclusive. 

To be more specific My hypothesis is that (i dont know how to coin it - political violence or police brutality) getting arrested and getting fined by the police during protests, gave these guys prestige during the movement because the police became seen as evil ones. its kind of like how gandhi got popular, showing nonviolence and having hunger strikes and then getting arrested boosted popularity and thus votes, the police created heroes and martyrs. These heroes and martyrs led parties, these leaders got elected, and got 19% of the popular vote, which is the phenomenon i try to explain- as it is considered Very high in that semi democratic electoral system. I just hope that i am able to separate the IV from the DV clearly enough to gather useful inferences

A problem is that these parties only came about after the movement, and not before, therefore i cant compare how XYZ party performed before and after. Because they were really spawned by the very movement itself. 

At the moment i have interviews with these “elected” parties, and interviews with some of the most active participants of 2014 who then supported these parties to varying degrees. What recurred most among the voters was that Heroism is quite important - I got alot of sentences like “he is some one who really cares about HK and he sacrificed himself in 2014 for HK, so I voted for him.” And “ on basis of morality”

I am wondering if there is a way i can use text/content analysis (lets say social media posts by parties, newspaper text) as a way to establish some kind of correlation between X party position (in relation to the main demand of the movement as well as Police brutality) and Votes, this is to also rule out certain rival hypotheses

"You might be correct that Skinner was misunderstood and that his concept of behavior is as 'confusing' as you explain, which allowed for misinterpretations. I would say that it is nonetheless true that behavioral psychology was and is commonly considered black-box psychology. Still, it is good to point out that Skinner did criticize the term. On the other hand, I understand that his objection was rooted on neurology and biological/neurological explanations, rather than ""the content of the mind"".

Regarding behaviorist movements and biological explanations, I do not object - I was giving a couple of famous examples and could have nuanced my statement or made the ties to biology (and neurology) clear.

I do find it puzzling to suggest that there is little difference between cognitivism and behaviorism (at least in the past). I would suggest that behaviorism as is understood stresses learning through external stimuli and consequences, with a focus on observable and measurable outcomes, whereas cognitivism stresses learning through mental mechanisms, with a focus on internal structures and processes. Likewise, I would suggest that the cognitive revolution did change much and that the American school of psychology was strongly influenced, if not dominated, by the notion of ignoring mental content, whereas the cognitive revolution revitalized the study of what goes on ""inside"". It might be that, as I stated earlier, Skinner was misunderstood and that other behaviorists would argue against this depiction of the history of psychology re: behaviorism and cognitivism, I will take note of that and keep it in mind.

"That is quite reductionist, and ignorant of qualitative research's value in generating research questions, giving shape to hypotheses and constructing theory. It is also useful and important to understand realities that cannot be adequately distilled and explained by numbers, or at least as a valuable companion to the interpretations of quantitative data. And qualitative research can certainly help ""test or disprove"" theories that are not compatible with observed reality.

Case studies, observational studies, etc. are not about being representative of the population. They are not anecdotal evidence neither, as an observation is anecdotal because it is collected informally via experience, rather than structured by methodology, which is not the case of qualitative research. With the correct methodology and with scientific rigor and integrity, the result of qualitative research can absolutely be as valid as quantitative research in their own rights. It is however disingenuous to compare the two fields on the same exact terms, as they do not share the same identical aims (such as generalization).

Sure, as there is bad quantitative research, there is bad qualitative research. And as there is bad social science, there is also bad ""hard"" science - shall we ignore the likes of discredited doctor Andrew Wakefield because it is easier to criticize social science as second class? Also, let's not confuse humanities and social science, such that a journal like Hypatia is a journal of philosophy, which would belong to the former category of academia.

To conclude, no - what ""these examples"" show is that if you try often enough you'll find outlier cases where some journals, which are not exactly representative of the whole of social sciences and some of which are arguably humanities journals, accepted a minority of bogus articles (7 out of 21?) which, them too, were not all social science papers.

"They are different theories and/or approaches that can be understood in different ways according to the context (research, therapy, psychology, sociology, etc.). An expert of philosophy in this thread has provided you with something to read in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. I will attempt to answer you from the perspective of a social scientist (not that I am suggesting philosophers and social scientists live in separate worlds or are necessarily separate people).

&amp;#x200B;

**Blank state or** ***tabula rasa*** refers to the theory that humans develop their abilities and knowledge after being born, from experience, by perceiving the world and interacting with it. Chomsky is a good example of the opposite position, as according to him human are pre-wired to learn language (it is *innate*). Research in psycholinguistics would support that position.

Arguably, **behaviorism** is an approach to research but also a theory. The simplest explanation is that behaviorists believe that the human mind is a black box and that we should not waste time studying it, because we cannot actually ""see inside it"". Thus we can (or should) only care about the outcomes, the reactions, what we can actually see and measure directly: behavior. Thus, researchers such as Pavlov and Skinner were interested in studying human behavior and in explaining human behavior as reactions to conditioning, reinforcement, punishment. It lost popularity with the cognitive revolution, and I don't think there are (many) psychologists today that would fully commit to behaviorism (although that does not mean behavioral research is meaningless or valueless). Have an [essay by Skinner](http://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/1991-08735-001.pdf) on the topic.

**Social constructionism** is another approach, and set of theories. It is about how knowledge and human perception are socially constructed, and how our reality is socially determined. Or in other words, we don't all perceive things in the same way, and how we see the world and understand it can differ according to social groups, culture, etc. Gender exists because through interaction and history humans determined that ""people with breasts"" are female and ""people without breasts"" are male and that females behave in a certain manner, and males in another manner, and each have different roles, et cetera. Crime does not exist per se, it is society that created laws and [labelled certain behaviors as ""criminal"" or ""deviant""](https://leeclarke.com/courses/intro/readings/becker_definingdeviance.pdf).",NA,FALSE,NA,"Revue_of_Zero",NA,NA,1538558827,"t5_2sml9","t3_9kxqrv","t3_9kxqrv",4,1540632204,0,0,"e72xdz7","AskSocialScience",NA,NA,NA
"Scientists specifically, and science in general, are not ""protectors of humanity"". Science is about the pursuit of facts, empiricism, etc.

Members of society are responsible for each other, behave morally, respect the law, etc. and politicians as representatives of society should enact policy that benefits society as a whole. But this is theoretical, real life is not so perfect (unfortunately).

You can accuse me of ""begging the question"", but the fact is that I am *describing* how things are, not debating the nature of the social sciences. The *definition* of social science, and social scientists, is not whatever you are prescribing. If *you* believe that social scientists should be the ones protecting people, you can make your argument...but this isn't really the venue for that kind of discussion. I repeat, it is more for a philosophy subreddit or an opinion based subreddit.

&gt;When germs were found to be the cause of human suffering, science worked to teach the global working-class a new pedagogy of hygiene.

That is what science does, do studies and collect evidence to prove something. Of course scientists in general want to contribute something to society, but it is up to, for example, practitioners (e.g. surgeons) to implement hygiene standards according to scientific research and politicians to enact policy that promotes evidence-based hygiene. Each has their own role and powers. As of this moment, society is not ruled by a Philosopher King and scientists cannot enforce things unto society.

 &gt;As it stands based the comments I see, Social Science doesn't want to job of even determining in shootings actually human suffering.

You skipped a verbed. But in either case, then what do you do with the research about school shootings I pointed to you? Are they figments of imagination? Research on school shootings and their causes exist, thus social science *does* attempt to determine why school shootings happen and how to prevent them.

Your statements can only be supported if you entirely ignore all the scientific literature on topics such as school shootings, violent crime, etc.

And regarding your last statement, that is also false. There are scholars do criticize (e.g. critical criminology) how things work. And regarding the USA, [Michael Tonry](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/518582) does comment on the fact that one of the problems is that politicians do not care too much about expert opinions.

It's true that Marx was largely, in the tradition of the old political economists, trying to explain his contemporary situation more than he was trying to explain the past (he explicitly says he's not doing that) or predict the future, but his model of how the capitalist system has that assumption of eventual failure built in. He failed to anticipate that the superstructure can adapt, sometimes rapidly, and that those changes can keep the system running.

"So the argument is that since he built it / paid for its construction, he is entitled to some money for its use, right?

Option 1: this is because he financed it therefore if you use it you need to cover the initial cost. Under this view there is no speculation or exploitation, you are just paying for the cost of construction. If that is the case, after how many years do u become the owner of the apartment? When is the cost repaid? Counting interest! 

... That doesn't happen. The property is never yours, you are forced to pay forever, an unbounded ever growing amount. This option is a nonstarter.

Option 2: this is because given the fact that he spent money on it, he deserves to make more money than what he spent. This is where the exploitation comes from. If he is to make more than whatever the cost was, where is the difference coming from? Me, paying rent with my work. What is the landlord's contribution in all this? Capital - that is, he is entitled to my work because he started off rich. It is important to note that this isn't a meaningless marginal matter - rent is often more than half your income, and the people that collect it are often unfathomably rich, often with no other job.

Another couple things to mention: this is possible because by buying up all houses and keeping them at a loss (something property owners are keen to point out is that it costs a lot to upkeep a house), there is no market for housing that hasn't got a large part of the price bundled up in speculation. That is, if you were keeping a house with nobody in it with an upkeep in taxes and other costs of several hundred dollars a month, you'd want to get rid if it. Heck, the price would be *negative*! Yet no homeless people are payed to take those properties off of a landlord's hands, because by keeping up the cartel everyone (of them) benefits in increased property value and rent extraction. This is of course possible because of the inherent threat of violence towards anybody that doesn't pay up - eviction, homelessness, which is punishable by law, and may lead to incarceration and indentured servitude in the for profit private prison system. If people didn't need a house to live, or had reasonable alternatives, this wouldn't happen.

So to your question my answer is: sure would be unfair if I just lived in an apartment that wasn't mine, but is keeping empty houses to drive up prices and collect rent truly the correct solution to the problem?

"You've missed the point of the analogy. You cannot say the capitalist being a necessary part of capitalist production excuses him from judgements unless you are willing to say the same thing of the slave owner. 

&gt; Did you really need me to spell that out for you?

I explained why -- I quoted Marx including that type of work in the total labor involved in the production of a commodity, which seemingly contradicts your main complaint. I was seeking clarification because you must feel that he actually did *not* include that type of work, and I could not see how that was the case (and still cannot).  

Marx is focused not on the instrinsic, material nature of anything but its social nature -- this is why things are *capital* only in certain contexts, why labor is only *productive* in certain contexts, why *value* can exist only in certain contexts. He sums up what I (still can only) suspect is your complaint by saying that

&gt;only the narrow-minded bourgeois, who regards the capitalist form of production as its absolute form, hence as the sole natural form of production, can confuse the question of what are productive labour and productive workers from the standpoint of capital with the question of what productive labour is in general, and can therefore be satisfied with the tautological answer that all that labour is productive which produces, which results in a product, or any kind of use value, which has any result at all.

I've provided Marx talking about managerial work and considering it productive labor, so what I'm after is an account of where that is insufficient for you.

Regarding the **second part of your comment.**

&gt;It's intended as a critique of the capitalist system....[etc]

As critique in the broad sense, this is a fair enough answer. But a deterministic view of history that inevitably leads to communism is not a fair reading of Marx; however, I think that any accurate reading of Capital will see a call to revolution. 

I will mention it again later, but labor is not a commodity -- it's labor power, which is very different. Additionally, it's important to understand that alienation is not a psychological state in a subject, but a particular social relationship; we are alienated whether we feel alienated or not. These are minor quibbles and not all that relevant though.

&gt;Marx discusses a few different definitions for value, but mostly focuses on use-value and exchange-value.

What are these different definitions of value? Use-value and exchange-value are not types of value (obviously they are, dictionary-wise) for what Marx is talking about. In Chapter 1 of *Capital* he writes that commodities are use-values and values -- exchange-value is just the phenomenal form of value, how a commodity reveals itself as a value, and *the only* form in which value manifests. It does no harm, and is simpler, to talk about exchange-value because of this fact, *but* it must be kept in mind that exchange-value and value are distinct things; it is **wrong**, strictly speaking, to say that commodities are use-values and exchange-values. 

&gt;Use-value is roughly analogous to what we think of today as utility (e.g. food is useful for eating, shoes are useful for wearing), while exchange-value is defined by the amount of socially necessary labor that goes into producing a commodity;

You have a correct understanding of use-value, but you are mistaken about what exchange-value is. In the Appendix to Capital 1 on the value-form, Marx makes clear that exchange-value is, similar to use-value, the property of being exchangeable. You can find this in his commentary about the fact that there is no quantitative definiteness to the commodity playing the role of equivalent, and that it is by showing itself as *immediately exchangeable* that it is *exchange-value:* 

&gt;Hence a commodity is only exchangeable with another commodity insofar as it possesses a form in which it appears as value. A body of the commodity is immediately exchangeable with another commodity insofar as its immediate form i.e. its own bodily or natural form, represents (vorstellt) value with regard to another commodity or counts as value-form (Wertgestalt).

This quote both captures exchange-value as immediate exchangeability and as the phenomenal form of value, the manner in which commodities reveal themselves as values. From the same appendix, ""what concerns the commodity functioning as equivalent is that it counts for another commodity as the shape of value (Wertgestalt), **a body in immediately exchangeable form – exchange-value.**""

A commodity can have multiple exchange-values, and while exchange-value will always be accompanied by a definite quantitative ratio, *it is important to understand the qualitative nature of exchange-value.* This is also why it is wrong to say that exchange-value is defined by the **amount** of labor, as you do. 

The substance of value is abstract labor; commodities express themselves as values in exchange-value, as being immediately exchangeable with each other is how they show they share in this substance; and there is always an amount of this type of labor, a *magnitude of value.* Having a use-value, being an object of utility (and a single object can have different uses in different contexts, etc), is a prerequisite for being exchangeable. 

When you say that

&gt;Broadly speaking, since labor is a commodity,

you are making a very basic mistake that Marx goes more than out of his way to correct, and is central to his argument. Labor is not a commodity, labor is not sold by the worker to the capitalist, but *labor power,* the capacity to labor. Surplus-value is possible by the very fact that it is not labor, but labor power, that the capitalist purchases.

"&gt;Just as at first the capitalist is relieved from actual labour so soon as his capital has reached that minimum amount with which capitalist production, as such, begins, so now, he hands over the work of direct and constant supervision of the individual workmen, and groups of workmen, to a special kind of wage-labourer. An industrial army of workmen, under the command of a capitalist, requires, like a real army, officers (managers), and sergeants (foremen, overlookers), who, while the work is being done, command in the name of the capitalist. The work of supervision becomes their established and exclusive function.

Managerial labor is purchased as part of the variable capital initially advanced.  Unless the manager is essentially a stand-in for the capitalist, and merely oversees the process, it is highly likely that they play some necessary role in production, and produce surplus value.

"&gt; A machine provides services to people. It performs a part of a production process. A house provides the service of shelter and a few other things.

Ok, so I think your argument here is that landlords invest in houses, so either directly or indirectly they create a demand for houses and finance their construction. The service landlords are doing therefore is providing capital investment for the construction of these houses. There are three things which I feel you are undervaluing here.

First, that the demand for houses doesn't need any incentive - it is always there because houses are a necessity. There is no need, nay, there is no *benefit* to having people invest in houses instead of directly producing the houses that people need. You could argue that there would need to be a capital in order to finance this production, but the state has infinite capital and can provide the starting financial assistence required, asking for very small or no ROI since it's for the public good, so there would be no lack of demand nor lack of financial capacity for a public necessity. In the case of machinery to improve production, there is a vested societal interest in having machines that help produce more (we all benefit from them), therefore providing returns on that investment can be thought as providing incentive towards doing something good for society. There is no symmetry with the housing investment - you are providing incentive for hoarding necessities and renting them.

This ties into number two: you are ignoring the actual violent reality of landlord monopoly. Homeless people die of exposure, struggle with keeping a job (if they still have one), are persecuted for their own poverty by the police and the justice system, struggle with reintegration in society and so on. These people aren't born homeless. They become homeless through eviction - their life is ruined because a landlord has decided that their profit margin is more important than providing shelter and housing to those people. You may argue that these people ""deserve"" this somehow, but the factual reality is that landlords are still implicated in a system that ruins people in order to preserve their return on investment.

And thirdly, I invite you to consider what the commodification of housing and the ability to leverage the right to grant basic necessities has done to the housing market in general. Having a house that is empty is a net loss: you are paying taxes and maintenance on it, yet it gives you no return on investment. Yet there are a LOT of houses that are kept empty due to the speculative nature of rent seeking. In the ideal free market where everything is for sale, these goods would have a *negative price* if taken at face value (they are losing me money!) yet there is the speculative value generated by the fact that *people need houses*. If I keep these houses for myself, as a landlord of many different apartment complexes, I may keep the rent high on the rest of my properties and turn a net profit. I think you can agree with me that a cartel monopoly of a necessary good is not a good thing for society - yet that is exactly how the housing market in big metropolitan areas works.

&gt; If there were no return to capital then all great fortunes would be eventually depleted. There would be no new capital investment.

I fail to see ""all great fortunes would be eventually depleted"" as a negative. The argument that there would be no new investment if people didn't amass huge amounts of personal wealth falls flat when considering:

1 - the possibility of cooperative behavior, from crowdfunding to cooperatives to good ol' corporations

2 - the fact that sovereign states can produce any amount of capital investment at any time

&gt; I agree that money and the means of production aren't the same thing. What does this have to do with what I've written above?

The effect investment has is to physical capital what return of investment as you have been talking about it is to financial capital. Concrete material advantages for society and additional money in a personal supply are not comparable.

&gt; The position of the state is just like the co-op in my example above. Investment in capital requires sacrifice now by the citizens of that state. It produces gains later.

The state is nothing like any other financial agent because the state can print money. There is no solvency issue with the state, the boundaries are set by inflation and unemployment only. That means, in turn, that the only thing the state needs to consider when financing something with their capital is whether or not the overall effect on the economy will be of higher inflation / unemployment rate and whether the ""cost"" in those two is worth the benefit of the investment. Meaning that, for example, financing the building of houses that people need would be a net positive as it reduces unemployment, creates something of value, and the inflation can be kept in check through property taxes on the new building as needed.",NA,FALSE,NA,"TheMormegil92",NA,NA,1540803361,"t5_2sml9","t3_9r8v0k","t1_e8hhoqm",3,1541586383,0,0,"e8niym9","AskSocialScience",NA,NA,NA

"I cannot speak for the consensus in psychology of emotions, however what you describe does not sound exceptional. I assume the psychologist was referring to something like the [facial feedback theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_feedback_hypothesis). The concept of [using a pencil in the mouth](http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1988-25514-001) to create an artificial smile that should affect affect is a textbook experiment. Although recently there was a [failure to replicate](https://www.nature.com/news/psychologists-argue-about-whether-smiling-makes-cartoons-funnier-1.20929) the results, I don't think this points to emotions being purely subjective and psychological phenomena (based on other studies). In any case, that there is a relationship between emotions and culture is far from novel. As [Ekman](http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1993-32252-001?casa_token=3NGYCD7tydEAAAAA:pJ4W63Fivaql2yIcbJEjY9r2L_LCa4_u2XZ617wGKXTlyiM9MbNgpexShLs1J-hlYkKfEhJ3SNwjIrQ68tPVVqrB) concluded in 1992:

&gt;When I began my study of facial expressions, I thought there was just one question to be answered—are they universal or culture specific. I found more than one answer; different aspects of expression are both universal and culture specific.

I cannot say if consensus has changed, but even if emotions are considered to be universal, they are also considered to be affected by culture and it is recognized that some cultures might not have a specific word for, e.g. ""sadness"" in their lexicon.

Likewise, nothing exceptional regarding the example about sight and tactile recognition. Here's a [study on the topic](https://web.stanford.edu/~paulsko/papers/Molyneux_NatureNeuro2011.pdf):

&gt;We tested their ability to visually match an object to a haptically sensed sample after sight restoration. We found a lack of immediate transfer, but such cross-modal mappings developed rapidly.

It does appear that blind people who (re)gain sight are unable to immediately objects known by touch, but they can develop the ability soon after. Both this development and the initial inability can be explained by neuroplasticity, as in the brain adapts to being blind.

I would conclude suggesting that no, generally speaking the literature does not suggest humans are entirely blank states, we are born either way with certain basic abilities and the potential to develop them (such as the ability to associate objects between their appearance and how they feel, or the ability to feel emotions, express them and recognize them). One can talk more about tabula rasa in relation to social objects (we are not born knowing a 'circle is called circle' or that 'women wear heels'), although there is the matter of how human are inclined to categorize by nature, for example.",NA,FALSE,NA,"Revue_of_Zero",NA,NA,1539675830,"t5_2sml9","t3_9ofnqp","t3_9ofnqp",3,1541104255,0,0,"e7uwnzn","AskSocialScience",NA,NA,NA

"I don't know about other places, but here (Brazil) is normally other forms of sustaining ourselves and a frugal life.

For example, most of the country eats rice and beans at lunch and dinner, because they are the cheapest forms of carbs and protein possible, they cook everything from scratch and complement the diet with whatever is on sale. (It is not difficult to eat 0.20 cents of USD per day),

Also, most people use their feet to go around to not spnd in transportation.

Also they usually do not spend a lot in living as normally the land is stolen as most of the country's land (or anything of value) is owned by the government and those that are not are owned by the rich people. The same thing happens for internet, water and energy, as people enter the grid's but stealthily so.

Finally, they tend to take anything they find valuable to complement their homes, like old wood to make wardrobes, fixing old TV sets to have any or cut the electric grid's cables to make their own homes cables.

Basically, when people are forced to survive, they will do anything to survive.

"I am not able to provide data proving or disproving your first point, but I wouldn't rule out that those trends also vary more locally, for example if greater broadband access is also related to local development, greater access to information and greater awareness of issues related to sexual abuse, which might be confused with changes in official stats. Just some quick alternative hypotheses to bounce around. And this is without taking into account, I would add, that they did not directly study porn consumption - there are other ways in which Internet might contribute to criminal behavior.

Regarding your second point, I am largely unconvinced by their attempts to account for changes in reporting behavior, as they focused on the possibility that Internet access reduces cost of reporting or that it increases the criminal justice system's efficiency, inducing more people to report (and thus there being more benefits), according to a very rational choice approach (not that it's weird or surprising considering the journal).

According to their paper, they checked for ""charge rate"", ""conviction rate"", ""time elapsed"" and ""likelihood of identifying the perpetrator"" or ""of closing a case due to lack of evidence"". These are interesting to account for, but not exactly sufficient to cover the limitations of official data. 

Many important factors known to influence official statistics are not accounted for (at least during interpretation or considerations of the data source), such as changes in the political climate and in both official and unofficial policy, changes in police behavior (who can dissuade victims from reporting, or not properly record incidents for several reasons documented in the literature) and changes in victim behavior, which might trend together with the development of broadband access.

No it's not a neoclassical perspective. Mainstream economics is about growth, business cycles, international trade and microeconomic issues like labour. The idea that Economics is all about distribution is a distinctly Classical or Marxist one.

"Governmental authority is principally interested in protecting property rights. Even people who believe that the role of government should be minimal tend to believe that government should use it's police powers to ensure that majorities don't impugn the property rights of minorities and to minimize externalities (for example [Carl Menger 1871](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Economics-Carl-Menger-ebook/dp/B0053TYI06) and [a litany by Buchanan and Tullock](https://www.amazon.com/Calculus-Consent-Collected-Works-Buchanan/dp/0865972184)).

Madison's [Federalist 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_No._10) discussed his concern that a tyranny of a majority would undermine the property rights of a minority. Federalist 10 was likely a reaction to [Shays Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shays%27_Rebellion) in which debtors (a majority) attempted to nullify their debts owned by a minority of lenders; an example of an attack on the property rights of the lenders in a poorly institutionalized democracy (colonial Massachusetts). Similar examples exist during and immediately after the glorious revolution when Jewish lenders were stripped of their property rights to leans they held over English debtors and the English economy slowed as a result.

The problem is that if property rights are not stable and protected, lenders (for example) will not lend, and considerable dead weight losses will result from non-optimal prices for capital. When property rights are stable then ""the market"" is able to orient itself so as to minimize the dead-weight losses which occur as a result and thus achieve a more efficient price-point on the supply and demand curves.

Pluralist governance protects property rights, in the way Madison hoped it would, through decentralization and multiplicity. No ""faction"" is able to grow so large as to seek considerable rents or secure substantial private goods from the government. Interestingly Kang ([2002, Crony Capitalism](https://www.amazon.com/Crony-Capitalism-Development-Philippines-Comparative/dp/052100408X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1537477622&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Kang%2C+David+Crony+capitalism)) found that states with a small population of elites and a centralized government were also also able to protect property rights as a result of the naturally low transaction costs between elites and government. This seems most like the merchant oriented property rights that you describe where government strikes a bargain with merchants and the agreement is protected via a prisoners dilemma stalemate. Such arrangements occur, see South Korea pre-1997. However, Prisoners dilemmas are fragile and exogenous shocks, such as the Korean financial crisis, can disrupt the elite-government agreements and erode property rights, see Korea post-1997.

According to [Coase's theorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Problem_of_Social_Cost) ([Coase 1960](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/466560)), how and to who one assigns property rights is irrelevant as long as the rights are stable. Once property rights are assigned and stable the market, via the invisible hand, will be able to orient and minimize dead weight losses that would otherwise occur by compensating (through negotiation or courts) those who's rights were infringed upon.

Because transaction costs ultimately limit the size to which a private firm can grow ([Coase 1937](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C9&amp;q=coase+1937+nature+of+the+firm&amp;btnG=)) and because transaction costs limit the ability of elected officials to oversee the bureaucracy ([Swartz and McCubbins 1984](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C9&amp;q=Congressional+oversight+overlooked%3A+Police+patrols+versus+fire+alarms&amp;btnG=)) both governments and firms have an incentive to develop institutions which minimize transaction costs. For legislators the reward is being better able to achieve their agenda and achieve reelection. For firms the benefit is, obviously, the residual interest (profits).  Additionally, creating institutions which minimize-transaction costs also increases government stability ([Linz and Stepan 1996](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C9&amp;q=linz+and+stepan+toward+consolidated+democracies&amp;btnG=&amp;oq=linz+and+)) and thus results in confidence that property rights will be maintained in the future.

Marx never formalized 'base' and 'superstructure'.  Interpretations of him in this vein tend to lead to a sort of dualism, rather than viewing them as part of a totality.  The picture you linked is an extrapolation based in him, but too rigid.

This paragraph, from the Preface to the Critique of Political Economy is where I believe this comes from.

&gt;In the social production of their existence, men inevitably enter into definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely relations of production appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material forces of production. The totality of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which arises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. The mode of production of material life conditions the general process of social, political and intellectual life. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their social existence that determines their consciousness. At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or – this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms – with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto.  From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution. The changes in the economic foundation lead sooner or later to the transformation of the whole immense superstructure.

"&gt;Do locales with legal prostitution have lower rates of assault against children?

The benefits of either decriminalizing or legalizing (aspects of) prostitution is arguably a controversial topic as it also involves ethical issues concerning sex work itself (e.g. not only conservative and religious groups may support prohibition, but some [feminist groups](https://www.rapereliefshelter.bc.ca/campaigns/abolition-prostitution/abolition-prostitution) too, albeit for different reasons).

&amp;#x200B;

Some scholars criticize legalization by suggesting that, [for example](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1077801204268607?casa_token=5sTZ9EpAirMAAAAA:qIs-coSMrUZw0QjjU-OVfCwTDD5KAjvVzeL6f84yg1mAkHMKzhhw2op7zz9Xo4lHhJDgprUNEeY), “legal sex businesses provide locations where sexual harassment, sexual exploitation, and violence against women are perpetrated with impunity” and that “\[s\]tate-sponsored prostitution endangers all women and children in that acts of sexual predation are normalized—acts ranging from the seemingly banal (breast massage) to the lethal (snuff prostitution that includes filming of actual murders of real women and children)”.  A related issue is that of the relationship between [human trafficking and prostitution](http://www.ifn.se/wfiles/wp/wp996.pdf), the idea being that legalizing the latter contributes to the former. But the actual issue might be in the kind of model implemented, and how.

An argument that can be made is that while legalization can [make the “vulnerable more vulnerable”](https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/bitstream/2134/4493/1/HUBBARD_SCOULAR_canter_book_chapter.pdf), the problem lies in how prostitution is legalized. For example, in the U.K., prostitution laws have pushed sex workers off-street. But as Hubbard and Scoular observe:

&gt;Sex workers can still be financially exploited, injured or killed when working off-street – particularly when premises are not surveyed or acknowledged by the authorities \[…\] this apparently laissez-faire approach has delineated a private sphere of non-intervention, creating an unregulated market in which private forms of commercial sex are, by omission, sanctioned \[…\] We hence conclude by arguing for policies that recognise that sex will always be bought and sold, and which do not seek to criminalise it or simply push it out of sight, but allow it to occur as safely, as orderly and as fairly as possible”.

Likewise, this [Swiss study](https://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/252621/1/Rotlicht_Schweiz_Bericht_KRC_final.pdf) recognizes that “\[a\]busive situations can develop in all sectors of this market” and that “the answer cannot be either or, but needs to consider contradictory aspects”, recommending that “regulations should be designed to increase sex workers’ protection without infringing on transparency and predictability for both sex workers and managers”.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, what about the link between prostitution and sexual abuse? There is research suggesting that legalization can reduce sexual abuse and rape. For example, “Our difference-in-difference analysis using data on the largest 25 Dutch cities between 1994 and 2011 shows that [opening a legal street prostitution zone decreases registered sexual abuse and rape by about 30% to 40% in the first two year](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/110765/1/dp9038.pdf)” and in Rhodes Island they found that “[decriminalization caused both forcible rape offenses and gonorrhea incidence to decline for the overall population](https://www.nber.org/papers/w20281). Our synthetic control model finds 824 fewer reported rape offenses (31 percent decrease)”.

&amp;#x200B;

O.K., then - are all child abusers pedophiles? [According to Seto:](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6874943_Pedophilia_and_sexual_offenses_against_children)

&gt;There is an intuitive and empirical association between sexual inter­ests and behavior, but the two are not synonymous. Some pedophiles have not engaged in sexual behavior with children (Fedoroff et al., 2001), some sex offenders with child victims are not pedophiles (e.g., Freund, Watson, &amp; Dickey, 1991), and many pedophilic sex offenders with child victims have had adult sexual partners \[…\]

"Generally speaking, the link between mental illness and violent crime is [sensationalized](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3935671/) and people who have mental health issues are more likely to be [victims](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1525086/) than perpetrators.

There is a known association between [substance use (alcohol, drugs, etc.) and violence](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S135917890100057X) and having [both a mental illness and using substances](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/210191) can contribute together to violent behavior (but one has to keep in mind the complex relationship between these two, such that the latter can provoke the former, or co-occur for self-medication, etc.).

*But* at the same time,[substance use is related with victimization](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1360-0443.1994.tb00876.x), for example because people undertake riskier behaviors or frequent risky places (e.g. to get drugs). It also depends on the substance, such that some drugs make people more lethargic or vulnerable, than active and violent.

Finally, although there is literature suggesting a link between [homelessness and engagement in criminal activity](https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/lbrr/archives/cnmcs-plcng/cn35305-eng.pdf), it is important to note that it is often not *violent* crime:

&gt;Homeless persons are less likely to be charged  with violent offences, and more likely to be charged with property-related offences, such as those which meet their survival needs (Gowan, 2002; Novac et al., 2006)

It also has to be kept in mind that bivariate relationships are too simple: these are vulnerable populations without many important protective factors. In fact, homeless people are more likely to be victimized than homed people. The literature shows that [homelessness plus mental health issues or substance use](https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/ps.50.1.62) increases risk of victimization.

This is to illustrate and nuance the complexity of the topic, which is too often forgotten in the public discourse.

"I'm a bit confused. In Chapter 7, we are told that:

&gt;This metamorphosis, this conversion of money into capital, takes place both within the sphere of circulation and also outside it; within the circulation, because conditioned by the purchase of the labour-power in the market; outside the circulation, because what is done within it is only a stepping-stone to the production of surplus-value, a process which is entirely confined to the sphere of production.

Sitting down and turning shoes into leather *is* outside of circulation, as part of the production process, and your phrasing implies the opposite; the point is not to show that new *value* can be created (although it is), but that *surplus-value* cannot be. 

It is also not clear what you mean by managerial work, as the people hired to purchase leather, recruit and hire (other) workers, organize workers, supervise the production process, and so on are

&gt;different labour capacities which cooperate together to form the productive machine as a whole contribute in very different ways to the direct process by which the commodity, or, more appropriate here, the product, is formed, one working more with his hands, another more with his brain, **one as a manager**, engineer. or technician, etc., **another as an overlooker**, the third directly as a manual worker, or even a mere assistant, more and more of the functions of labour capacity are included under the direct concept of productive labour, and their repositories under the concept of productive workers, workers directly exploited by capital and altogether subordinated to its valorisation and production process. If one considers the total worker constituting the workshop, his combined activity is directly realised materialiter in a total product which is at the same time a total quantity of commodities and in this connection it is a matter of complete indifference whether the function of the individual worker, who is only a constituent element of this total worker, stands close to direct manual labour or is far away from it. But then: **The activity of this total labour capacity is its direct productive consumption by capital, i.e. it is capital’s process of self-valorisation, the direct production of surplus value**, and therefore — a point we shall develop further later on — the direct conversion of surplus value into capital.

"&gt;If the orthodox framework is unable to explain the world,

The large body of economic theory that exists is able to explain a wide variety of economic phenomena fairly well.

&gt;even produces the steepest grow in inequality since the first industrial revolution, would you call that a success?

Woah, you are making some really ridiculous implications here. Firstly, you are implying that economic theory somehow caused increases in inequality? Economic theory doesnt cause anything, it just explains how it works. For instance, when technological change augments The productivity of a subset of workers but not the other we can expect to see a divergence in the wages of the two groups according to economic theory. That explains reality perfectly - in recent decades technological change has altered productivities of skilled and unskilled workers in this way, and is the primary cause of the rise in income inequality in recent decades. Did economic theory cause the inequality? No. It explained it well - and offers insights to how inequality could potentially change going into the future, and which policy actions could alter the future path of income inequality or incomes. 

Secondly, you are implying those with the power to pass economic policy actually listen to economists, which is laughable. It couldn't be further from the truth. Neither politicians nor the public give a shit about economist's knowledge or policy prescriptions, and they pretty much never have. For more on that you can read Krugman's ""Economics has failed"", in which he says the field hasnt failed in terms of a science, but rather the field has failed with respect to convincing policy makers to act on what economists have learned/know, as they fail to even listen to introductory level econ.

&gt;[political economy] That is totally different than what mainstream economics propose and thinks like.

Acemoglu has been the worlds most cited economist for over a decade and bound for a nobel... So what are you talking about? You are just someone who has no idea what is going on on the field and your criticisms are purely out of ignorance

&gt;The rest is ideology, not models or math. The only difference is that some of us are actually honest about it and recognize economy isn't simply models and numbers. Not calling anyone out specifically, is just the mindset of the typical mainstream economics student.

The best do it because they are good writers and the substance of what they are saying makes their work shine.

It's the mediocre scholarship that generally gets the long sentences.

"&gt; A landlord doesn't contribute anything outside of capital to my apartment, yet he still gets my money every month.

Yes. He could sell your apartment and spend the money. He must be paid a fee to make it worthwhile for him not to do that.

All humans have *time-preference*, if you think about it, it's inevitable. We all prefer goods to come to us sooner rather than later. Would you rather have a house now, or one in ten years time? The answer is simple. This is why your landlord charges you a fee, it is a payment for his waiting. Of course, there can be other aspects to it. There's an entrepreneurial element to any investment. Also, a large part of rent is spent on maintenance or consumed by depreciation.

The same is true of any low-risk investment like a bond or a balance in a bank account. Higher risk investments involve additional things like risk premium.

We have two things here to discuss. Firstly, there's the productivity of capital and secondly there's the waiting for capital return. These are independent of the structure of society. They exist in a Centrally Planned economy or in an economy where every business is a co-operative.

Let's assume that every business is a co-operative owned by workers. My co-operative may decide to invest in new machinery to expand output in the future. That may mean it has to reduce payments to members for a few years to pay for the machinery. However, once the machinery is bought production will be more efficient. So, if the investment is successful then after it's made my co-op will make larger profits. It will make larger profits than competing co-ops who don't make similar investments.

This kind of competition eventually boils down to time-preference. As investment is made returns to further investment decline. Co-ops will invest capital until they're dis-satisfied with the return. For example, my co-op may find a plan that cost $100K and returns $110K in 10 years time. We may decide to pass on it because the rate of return on it is less than 1%. In that case we're showing time-preference, we're saying we'd rather have our consumption now rather than waiting the 10 years.

"If you're into more academic (but still very readable) literature, these are three very fundamental books on nationalism. They represent the modernist/constructivist school on nationalism, which posits that much of what we nowadays consider 'national identity' is not a natural product of history, biology and culture, but to a large extent either coincidental or socially and politically engineered. These theorists are highly respected and considered the main leaders of thought in the field.

**Ernest Gellner, _""Nations and Nationalism""_** (1983, but I think there are revised editions)

^ Gellner is considered the main guy introducing the theory that 'nations' are not simply a natural phenomenon, but a product of modernization in the 19th century (at least in Europe). Before the 19th century, national identification did not exist in the same way as we know it today. It emerged as a result of industrialization and urbanisation, Romanticism and political opportunism. Very good theoretical framework and will make you think differently about the world once you read it.

**Benedict Anderson, _""Imagined Communities""_** (1983 - yup, it was a good year for nationalism studies)

^ Anderson dives into a more conceptual discussion of what a nation is. Is it an extended family, is it a community of language or culture? He claims that it is a community that we believe to be a community, an 'imagined' one. It is a good companion to Gellner. Anderson focuses on the role of language and the emergence of print in creating communities of people that feel connected. This sometimes happened intentionally, and sometimes as a random historical development (if putting it a bit simplified).

**E.J. Hobsbawm, T. Ranger, _""The Invention of Tradition""_** (1983 - I'm not making this up) 

^ This one is less fundamental for nationalism studies but provides alot of useful examples of constructed and reproduced memory. It talks about how many traditions that we believe and assume to be ancient oftentimes orignate from much more recent times, and are developed with different, more instrumental purposes. A classic example is the Scottish tartan, which historically had a very different meaning than we (and even most Scots) think today.

**M. Billig, _""Banal Nationalism""_ (1995)**

^ This is a response to the dominance of (above) 'elite-led constructivism' theories, and the idea that nationalism only takes place in moments of crisis and war. Billig proposed instead the view that 'nationalism' can manifest itself in very everyday means, through which normal people like you and me are constantly reminded which nation were are (not) part of.

"I've described managerial work several times:

&gt; purchasing leather, hiring workers, organizing workers, etc

- Purchasing leather involves a great deal of planning, especially as the business grows larger.  You need enough on hand that all of your workers will be able to be busy all day making shoes, but not so much that it goes bad (drying out and cracking, for example) before the workers can finish leatherworking.
- I don't know if you've ever hired workers before, but it's a rather involved process.  Determining exactly the sort of worker you need, determining *how many* workers you need, what wage they should be paid, placing advertisements, reviewing resumes, interviewing, training them how your organization works once they're actually hired, and so forth.  In any organization larger than a couple hundred people, this is easily a full time job.
- Organizing workers means ensuring they're on time and productive, dealing with personnel issues (if your two best leatherworkers hate each other, you need to sit them down together and resolve their conflict), finding replacement workers when people go on vacation, or get sick, or otherwise can't work, that sort of thing.

Did you *really* need me to spell that out for you?

All of that work is quite necessary if the production of goods and services is going to get done; the comparison to slave ownership is wholly uncalled for.

--------------

&gt;in my first response I mentioned that one of your statements was false and it went unacknowledged.

Because it was asinine.

&gt;Maybe we can start with the basics? What do you think Marx's project is? What do you think value is? What do you think exchange-value is?

By Marx's project, do you mean writing Capital?  It's intended as a critique of the capitalist system.  The overarching theme is the contradictions he believes are inherent in the system which he argues will inevitably lead to the centralization of wealth, followed by a collapse once inequality reaches a point where workers can no longer afford to live.

Later on, he also discusses the various psychological negatives of treating labor as a commodity.  The alienation of the worker from the results of their work, the inability of the worker to direct their own life, the wedge driven between workers who become nothing more than cogs in a great capitalist machine, that sort of thing.

-----------

Marx discusses a few different definitions for value, but mostly focuses on use-value and exchange-value.  Use-value is roughly analogous to what we think of today as utility (e.g. food is useful for eating, shoes are useful for wearing), while exchange-value is defined by the amount of socially necessary labor that goes into producing a commodity; as described in the section I quoted above (any many other places throughout Capital).  

Broadly speaking, since labor *is* a commodity, it can be used as a measuring stick to define the value of all commodities, which is then expressed in units of money (a universal equivalent to commodities).",NA,FALSE,NA,"Mikeavelli",NA,NA,1540668402,"t5_2sml9","t3_9r8v0k","t1_e8k5ii0",2,1541531544,0,0,"e8k9msh","AskSocialScience",NA,NA,NA

"&gt;this is because he financed it therefore if you use it you need to cover the initial cost. Under this view there is no speculation or exploitation, you are just paying for the cost of construction. If that is the case, after how many years do u become the owner of the apartment? When is the cost repaid? Counting interest!

i don't get it. 

you're saying that rent is exploitation because eventually if they live there long enough, the person paying the rent will have paid more than what the apartment cost the owner. but the person who is paying rent knows this and willingly entered the exchange because there are ""short-term"" advantages to rent outside of things like buying a house through mortgage: e.g. if you want to live there temporarily, you don't want to spend too much money at once. if the person lives there for so long that they pay more than what a permanent place costs, that's on them for not just buying a permanent place. 

it's like if i promised my friend $20 today if he gives me back $25 in two weeks. is that ""exploitation"" because he is paying more than i am? i wouldn't say so, because my friend has the advantage of having the $20 earlier. 

&gt; but is keeping empty houses to drive up prices and collect rent truly the correct solution to the problem? Wouldn't it be better if houses went to the people that needed them instead of to the people that want to extract every bit of profit out of their investment by leveraging their massive previous wealth?

this is separate from what we are talking about previously. 

i agree that there are issues with housing prices being too high and that is exploitation, but your suggestion was that all forms of rent that an apartment owner would fine plausible are inherently exploitive. do you still stand by that? 

if all you're saying is that there are issues in the housing market of things being priced too highly, then i don't have an issue with that. if that's true, economists would likely recommend some type of government intervention to fix the market inefficiency.

"Gonna state the other point of view on this one.

From the non-mainstream point of view, economics as it is being taught today (that is - micro, macro, econometry, using a neoliberal / mostly GET approach) is complete bogus. It is detached from reality, mostly asinine, and perpetuated throughout the higher education systems because the people teaching it are, loosely speaking, pawns of capitalists. People go into economy, learn Microeconomy, take it as given, and then spend several years building on top of completely stupid foundations because they were assured that ""in the general model, these problems are ironed out"". Those that do then go on and study ""the general model"" have spent a lot of time working with these assumptions and take them for granted; moreover they are in academia, so they need to get published in journals, and that means conforming to what the rest of the people expect. It is self reinforcing and based on terribly shaking grounds.

Any non neoliberal branch of economics today has Marxist roots - even the very right wing interpretations of reality - because you cannot do class analysis without at least referencing Marx's ideas. You may want to explicitly refute Marx, but you're still addressing him. Mainstream economics doesn't engage with Marx whatsoever (there are no courses on Marx in typical economy/business universities), they just skip him and never go back (because they're too busy going up their own arse with completely idiotic theoretical models).

So from the point of view of someone that doesn't ascribe to the mainstream neoliberal school of thought, Marx is pretty much fundamental to understanding economics, and the persistence and prominence of neoliberal economics is in large part due to the fact that it was made to assist ideologically in the fight with the USSR and thus needed to stay as far away from Marx as possible. The refusal of modern economics to address Marx is a huge problem.

(Of course I would also say that Marx was pretty much right about a lot of things, but crucially the same points above could be made by people who do NOT agree with Marx at all - and they do exist! - as long as they see the flaws in the neoliberal microeconomic approach. It is theoretically possible to refute micro and NOT want to do a class based analysis of reality but I know of noone even trying to do that.)",NA,FALSE,NA,"TheMormegil92",NA,NA,1540468555,"t5_2sml9","t3_9r8v0k","t1_e8f1sx1",-3,1541444580,1,0,"e8f504l","AskSocialScience",NA,NA,NA
"That's questionable, but it depends very much on what sort of approach you take to Marx. I linked earlier to a piece which criticises both ""Frankenstein Marx"" (the piecing together of quotes) and ""Zombie Marx"" (scholastic reconstructions of his work without allowing for any modification) but that isn't the totality of Marxian economics. And probably not even the totality of Marx had he lived long enough to develop his ideas. The article tackles LTV head on:

&gt;I could go on. My point here is not to say “Aha! — Marx anticipated Alfred Marshall.” These are scattered fragments not developed into a coherent statement. Neoclassical concepts could actually be a tool to deal more systematically with this kind of problem, which Marx evidently felt was worth engaging with. But more broadly, my argument is that there is perhaps not such a gulf between Marx and certain aspects of neoclassical analysis as is often implied. Marx believed Ricardo’s labor theory of value was a great advance over Adam Smith’s eclectic “adding-up” theory of value, which neglected the interdependence of wages, profits and rent. Ricardo’s critique was, in a sense, a primitive general equilibrium critique of Smith’s partial equilibria. But the labor theory of value had problems of its own, most prominently the awkwardness involved in modifying labor values to take account of differences in capital intensity. Both Ricardo and Marx were well aware of the problem, but it is hard to avoid seeing Marx’s “transformation” solution as ad hoc in the manner of Ptolemy’s epicycles, even if put in a logically coherent form.

&gt;I have suggested that there are elements in Capital that point beyond the labor theory of value and towards supply-and-demand analysis, and I believe that any adequate theory of value needs to do this. It is not such a challenge to the basic results of the labor-value analysis as it may seem, either. Alfred Marshall himself argued in an appendix to his Principles of Economics that his marginalist analysis did not undermine Ricardo’s theory of long-run value, because in the long run producers shift between sectors chasing abnormally high and fleeing abnormally low returns to their investments, so that supply conditions determine price. Demand matters in the long run only to the extent that the quantity produced and sold affects the cost of production, due to economies of scale, inputs whose supply can be increased only at increasing cost, etc. That demand or “social need” could influence socially-necessary labor time and therefore value, Marx was fully aware.

&gt;There is little for Marxists to fear from importing the concepts of supply and demand schedules. The critical importance of labor time does not disappear, but can actually be put on a firmer footing, because it makes possible (1) a more elegant treatment of relative prices than the classical multistage analysis in which the impact of labor, capital and land are dealt with sequentially; and (2) a framework for dealing with relative prices in both the short and long run, and the relationship between them, whereas the classical analysis generally neglects or leaves the short run indeterminate.

"Like /u/zzzzz94 I'm a critic of Marx.  In this thread there's a lot of general discussion, but few specifics.  I'd like to talk about the specifics of why Economists disagree with Marx.

Others have pointed to the labour-theory-of-value.  This is probably the biggest problem with Marx.

The labour theory of value proposes that there is only one ultimate cost - the cost of labour.

The concept of cost cannot be completely objective. It always has a subjective element. As a result prices cannot be reduced to objective factors like labour input, even if markets are perfectly competitive.

Here are three of the main problems:

* In it's unimproved state, land has no human labour applied to it. Land still commands a price though.

* An investor must wait before earning a return on investment. Of course, we would all rather be rich now than rich later. So, this waiting involves a sacrifice, even if it is small. However, waiting is not labour. How much investors are prepared to wait affects capital accumulation, and therefore prices.

* Labour itself doesn't involve equivalent sacrifice for each hour of work. A beer taster and the cleaner of a sewer are sacrificing something quite different in their work (notice this applies even if the skill level is similar).


This is the beginning of the problem, there are many other aspects to it.

Marx attempted to put land outside the class of ""commodities"" dealt with by his form of Economics. On that issue Bohm-Bawerk wrote:

&gt; The exclusion of the gifts of nature (which would never have
entered the head of Aristotle, the father of the idea of equality
in exchange) is the less to be justified because many natural
gifts, such as the soil, are among the most important objects of
property and commerce, and also because it is impossible to
affirm that in nature's gifts exchange values are always established
arbitrarily and by accident. On the one hand, there are
such things as accidental prices among products of labor; and
on the other hand the prices in the case of nature's gifts are
frequently shown to be distinctly related to antecedent conditions
or determining motives. For instance, that the sale price
of land is a multiple of its rent calculated on an interest usual
in the country of sale is as well-known a fact as that the wood
in a tree, or the coal in a pit, brings a higher or lower price
according to differences of quality or of distance from market,
and not by mere accident.

""Karl Marx and the Close of His System"" p.71.

Today, Economists use different theories.  The underpinning of our thinking is a subjective concept of value.  That solves the problems that I've mentioned.

Marx claims that all workers in a market economy are exploited by the businesses they work for, and the owners of those businesses - the Capitalists.  He does that on the basis of the labour theory.  But, this comes about simply because Marx assumes that labour is the only ultimate cost.

That thinking then leads to the idea that the state is a conspiracy against the proletariat.  It also leads to the idea that profit must decrease over time as direct labour becomes a smaller part of business costs.  That leads to theory of the ""Crisis of Capitalism"".

All of this depends on the restrictive assumptions made right at the start.  The errors in those assumptions creates the rest and the whole edifice collapses.

These problems are described in several places. The effect of time-preference on interest comes from Bohm-Bawerk's books [""Capital and Interest""](http://www.econlib.org/library/BohmBawerk/bbCI.html) and [""The Positive Theory of Capital""](http://www.econlib.org/library/BohmBawerk/bbPTC.html). Irving Fisher used parts of it in his [""The Theory of Interest""](http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Fisher/fshToI.html). Modern mainstream interest theory owes a lot to Fisher's ideas. The problem of relying on only one type of ultimate cost is described in Bohm-Bawerk's book ""Karl Marx &amp; the Close of His System"". All of these books are old, but this is a very basic part of Economics and it hasn't changed significantly in a long time.

"&gt;So, getting back to my original question, do we know whether societies with ""healthier"" attitudes towards sex and the human body have lower rates of child assault?

I would suggest this question is in reality different than the earlier one. The earlier one is more about opportunities and based on the idea that maybe there are (e.g.) less sexually frustrated people with legal prostitution, and thus less people who would pounce on the opportunity to abuse a child. 

What can be said about attitudes and children? Probably the answer is affirmative. [Tonry](http://www.antoniocasella.eu/nume/Tonry_2014.pdf) provides arguments to support the notion that, at least partially, falling crime trends in the Western world are due to lower thresholds of tolerance for behaviour such as violence and sexual abuse. There is also something to be said about the development of the concept of ‘child’, which has changed over time, [although](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/childhood/): 

&gt;\[E\]xactly how the conception of childhood has changed historically and how conceptions differ across cultures is a matter of scholarly controversy and philosophical interest (see Kennedy, 2006). Thus Ariès argued, partly on the evidence of depictions of infants in medieval art, that the medievals thought of children as simply “little adults.” Shulamith Shahar (1990), by contrast, finds evidence that some medieval thinkers understood childhood to be divided into fairly well-defined stages.” 

In any case, arguments can be made about how the child was perceived by the law also changed with time, such that age of consent did not always exist and the conceptualization of rape of young girls has changed (was it an assault on public mores? a special case of rape?). As [Killias](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/A:1008792013662.pdf) argues: 

&gt;Whatever the true reason may be, it seems definitively that sexual abuse even of children was not a major concern to the criminal courts before 1800. Child abuse really seems to be a ‘modern’ crime.

Which is not to be interpreted as stating that children didn't get raped in the past (per our definitions), rather that its conceptualization or perception as criminal behavior is modern. Thus, it can be suggested that shifting attitudes and values, such as about children and about what is deviant sexual behavior, does affect child abuse rates. Does legalization of prostitution factor in? I cannot make the argument, but there might be a relationship between attitudes about sex work and sexual abuse, and child sexual abuse specifically. In any case, ""attitudes"" definitely have an important role.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Do locales with more acceptance of nudity have lower rates of assault against children?

I cannot say much, concretely, on the ‘nudist’ part of your question, as I am relatively ignorant about the subculture and am not aware of research in criminology concerning nudists. A cursory search found some older texts on the topic, such as [this paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224498709551357) which tackles the reputation of nudists in regard of sexual promiscuity and the such. Disclaimer: I am sharing this study just as just as a food-for-thought, and not because I consider it to provide particularly strong support to any specific hypothesis. In any case, it does show that there are both scholars who have defended the notion that ‘nudists’ have stricter mores/code of sexual conduct than non-nudists, and scholars who support the notion that ‘nudists’ are more sexually deviant. I would suggest the question does not have an answer at the moment. But I would also suggest that if there is any effect, it is probably limited to the group of people who share the same (nudist) subculture and does not extend, for example, beyond a nudist resort.

what economists accept as given, what they presuppose is exactly what motivated Marx's critique, which was after all *a critique of political economy*. What is obvious to economists, that businessman have choices is precisely what needs explaining; Marx's critique of capitalism is not a critique of its immorality, instead it asks how does a society have to be structured for this businessman to be able to make these choices which have these affects and why would anyone want to make them (having to make choices over investments or widget economies is not an invariant feature of human society, how do you get the category 'businessman' in the first place?).

"&gt; You are arguing that we need a return on investment in order to make capital investments. That is only true with a profit motive.

No.  My point is that we always have two things to consider.  Firstly, there's the productivity of capital.  Secondly, there's the cost or patience required to wait for investments to come to fruition.

Now, this is shows itself in a monetary form in our current economy.  It need not do that.

&gt; Consider a cooperative that is deciding on whether to expand: if there is no profit motive, the decision is made based on costs and benefits. Do we get something valuable from the expansion? Will it allow us to make better products, reach more people, produce more efficiently, work less, create something beautiful? Does it have a purpose? Is the time investment and the labour that goes into this thing worth the effect it has?

The things you mention here are in-kind returns from the investment.  They're still returns though, and their form doesn't really make much difference.  I know Marxists differ on this point.

Let's say that we have two co-ops.  Co-op X decides to invest in labour saving machinery.  It's members agreee not to pay out dividends for several years.  Co-op Y doesn't make any similar capital investment.

So, later on, co-op X has bought it's machinery.  In this case the members of co-op X can enjoy more leisure time and less work (or, presumably, they could produce more).  The members of co-op Y don't have this privilege.  Here, we have a group who have been patient (the member of co-op X) and we have a group who have not.  Then we have the capital accumulation which has led to higher returns for the members of co-op X.

As I said, none of this is particular to capitalism or any economic system.  It occurs if there is Central planning too, since different decisions can be taken.

&gt; But if, for example, the state is budgeting for most social benefits, then return on investment is not as important as the effects the investment has.

The ""effect the investment has"" is just another form of return on investment.  If the state is doing it nothing fundamental is changed.  People have to pay their taxes and if that goes towards investment, then that's a form of forced saving.

&gt; So... You're saying that owners need to be paid otherwise they'd stop being owners?

No.  Owners will consume their capital if there recieve no return.  If their is no return to capital, then nobody will create it.

&gt; But that's not what happens, because people need houses to live so we can stockpile the resources and essentially blackmail them instead. I am not paying my landlord to wait on something I would want him to do anyway. Sell the goddamn houses already! He is the one stockpiling precious resources and charging a premium for their use. Way to remove the existing systemic violence in favor of a poetic rendition of rational self interest.

I think it's useful to compare this to the two co-ops we have above.

Co-op X has invested and enjoys the benefits of that.  Co-op Y hasn't and does not.  Is this situation really much different to your landlord?

Perhaps the members of co-op Y accuse those of co-op X of hoarding capital.  But this can't change the situation in either case.

Perhaps the government expropriate co-op Y and redistribute their capital.  That doesn't change anything fundamentally.  The same actions are required to produce a return on capital.  No new return has been produced.  The same would be true of your landlord were expropriated.  In both cases, if there is no return to producing capital then nobody will produce it.

"You could probably get two main types of answers to this question, one based on critical theory and cultural analysis, another empirical, looking at behaviors and attitudes from a sociological or psychological perspective.

From a search of the scientific literature, it looks like researchers have only recently begun to distinguish different types of pornography, and thus, their potentially different uses and effects.

The article ""Finding Lolita: A Comparative Analysis of Interest in Youth-Oriented Pornography"" by Andrea Walker et al. appeared in Sexuality and Culture only in 2016 (Vol 20, No 3, pp. 657-683). Walker conducted an extensive literature review to show that types of porn have not previously been distinguished.

Using principal component analysis with web search data, the authors found four distinct groups: what they called ""teen"" porn, amateur porn, hentai inspired (including asian teen) porn, and lolita porn. 

Image searches showed a different grouping.

They conducted some US state-level ecological regressions with the search query types and demographic predictors, which are kind of interesting but don't really address your question.

In their discussion, the authors note: ""It would be prudent then for future research to include a content analysis of youth-oriented pornography on the internet, in order to examine the cultural, sociological, and psychological factors that may play a role in seeking out these kinds of pornographic images. Furthermore, in its exploratory nature, this research examined the behaviors of porn consumers, and does little to test the attitudes of pornography consumers, and the communities in which they live; research that examines these populations at a more micro level is therefore warranted.""

No study citing this one really addresses your question, so I think there is likely little empirical research on this.

"Great thoughts. Fellow psychologist, here. I think the landscape of the social sciences is massively uneven, here. Most of us who (attempt to) publish know that rigorous theory building is ignored far too often. We also know (sometimes for years, sometimes since last year) about the replication crisis, which has hit your subfield the hardest, possibly just because that's the first place anyone looked.

However, one takeaway from replication initiatives is that the majority of what's in our textbooks seems solid, if less impressive than originally claimed. Some appears to have been imaginary, and some other pieces appear to be approximately as advertised. This does not add up to any kind of ""throw it all out"" approach. I think one of the main conclusions from the shakeups of the last few years in psych (spreading quickly to other fields) is that our institutions and publishing incentives are a major problem.

"I think your premise is mistaken. 

Simply put, people (especially professional experts) ARE interested in these areas. It’s an issue when we look at historical cultures because we often don’t have surviving examples of commoner pop culture. But for the more modern states and cultures? Yeah absolutely they focus on commoner stuff and I can’t think of a single sociologist or anthropologist that does a serious study of a society or culture but ignores or is ignorant of its pop culture. 

For example. Off the top of my head I can reference ‘Arab Media: Power and Weaknesses’ (a set of essays). True it deals with a lot of politics but it does so in many cases by studying ‘commoner’ stuff, pop culture, comedy shows and sitcoms, news articles etc. An excellent documentary series online named ‘Borders’ looks at the daily lives of people living on the borders of states.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic\_treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill)

On a personal level (you can read those articles for a lot of research and results), I have found that mindfulness and keeping in touch with people from my past whose lifestyle hasn't been lifted helps keep me happier with the current lifestyle I have. I think knowing people who are still poor (as I grew up very poor) and in difficult circumstances is grounding in a way that reading about the experiences of people in third world countries (who are worse off, but whose experiences I can't relate well to). I purposefully do not live up to my capacity lifestyle-wise. This is less about keeping things (like eating out) ""special"" than about saving money, but it does have that pleasant side benefit. 

If you grew up in a third world country, I do believe your happiness would be relative, though it does depend on how much suffering you experienced in your daily life. I think it would also depend on whether or not you were able to look around and see people who were better or worse off than you or in the same situation. There are interviews with people who escaped from starvation and poverty in North Korea who found happiness in community and family, and I'd guess that was informed by the fact that they were all in the same situation.

There are a ton of studies on ""Keeping up with the Jones"" and happiness that indicate that happiness is relative to what you see around you. Here's one paper about it:

"What do you think of these comments in the Buzzfeed article?

&gt;*Mauricio A. T.*
&gt;I love how Buzzfeed avoids any mention to the paper that uses chapter 12 of Mein Kampf with feminist buzzwords and was accepted for publication.

&gt;*Jimmy I*
&gt;As the three researchers noted, many of these journals are major journals in the field, and Buzzfeed admits this fact. Buzzfeed is too triggered to accept the rest, though.

&gt;No control group was needed because no statistical claims were made. The project demonstrates exactly the point the authors were looking for -- that this scholarship is indistinguishable from satire. One of the papers had special recognition of excellent scholarship. It's genuinely amazing. This is not related to fraud, this is in fact spoof like Sokal -- there's actually no difference at all.

&gt;""The hoaxers began their project with the assumption that certain ideas are patently, laughably absurd. But some worry that this is a cynical bias and an affront to academic freedom and intellectual progress.""

&gt;This is some mind-blowing stupidity Buzzfeed managed to come up with this time. Some ideas ARE patently, laughably absurd -- such as tying white people in chains in classrooms as 'experiential reparations' to correct for slavery from 150 years ago (one of the ideas published in those articles). It doesn't take cynical bias or any affront to academic freedom or intellectual progress to recognize that. Who are these ""some"" that ""worry"" about this besides the SJWs Buzzfeed cites in this article?


&gt;*Austin R.*
&gt;I find it silly that the argument Buzzfeed repeats is that SOME of the hoaxed journals weren't well known or reputable. The argument of the hoaxing team is that NONE of their faulty work should have been published ANYWHERE.

&gt;*Drew M.*
&gt;This article seems to hint that academic jounals for STEM fields lack a robust peer review process as well. Here's a challange for BUZZFEED; submit a hoax academic paper in physics, chemistry, mathematics, or any engineering discipline; i'm betting it won't be published.


&gt;*Lina B.*
&gt;SCIgen-generated articles have been published. Some of them were peer-reviewed. Publishing questionable results of questionable experiments in questionable journals is quite a tactic among questionable people :) Obviously, the extent to which it's done is quite different in different fields but anything that has to do with people can't be free of possibility of corruption and bias. Author is childishly implying that it's not so bad since everyone's doing it which just shows that there is no better arguments.

&gt;*Lina B.*
&gt;""They set out from the get-go to prank these disciplines but not others.""

&gt;This arguement is so ridiculous, it's RIDUNCULOUS. This is not the first experiment of the sort (even this article points that out) and these experiments are always driven by the suspicions that particular journal, conference or filed of study habitually support questionable research practices or fraud. 

&gt;I've never seen anyone complaining that SCIgen targets only computer science. It's like saying to a police officer: ""Yeah, you caught this particular con artist but how many others are out there that you didn't even try to catch because you were so focused on this one?"" Excellent passive agressive way to try to devalue someone's achievements when you can't afford to be happy because the con artist is your friend.

"&gt;I'd be shocked if that wasn't the case. Almost everyone is more likely to be a victim of it

You are not wrong about what is broadly called the 80/20 rule of criminal behavior and victimization (i.e. a majority is caused or suffered by a minority). However, those kinds of statements should be understood in a more complex framework.

The notion is that, [for example](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227459065_Controlling_Crime_Strategies_and_Tradeoffs), “Persons with mental illness were eight times more likely to be robbed, 15 times more likely to be assaulted and 23 times more likely to be raped” compared to the general population, which marks people with poor mental health as particularly vulnerable to victimization.

Going past that, whether mental illness causes violent behavior is too much of a simple question for an issue that is complex and should be treated as such.

For example, mental illness is a broad category including several kinds of disorders with different symptoms, such that [Douglas, Guy and Hart](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19702378) (referenced above) recommend that:

&gt;\[...\]the general question should be abandoned in favor of the more complex and sophisticated question, “What particular symptoms of psychosis, under which situational circumstances, and in combination with which personal or situational factors, are associated with increased or decreased risk of various kinds of violence?.

As [Frank and McGuire](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227459065_Controlling_Crime_Strategies_and_Tradeoffs) explain: “There are many routes by which mental illness may make it more likely for an individual to engage in criminal activity.” Such that, if we focus only on schizophrenia, [for example](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.470.5459&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf), “'\[p\]ositive' psychotic symptoms, such as persecutory ideation, increased the risk of minor and serious violence, while 'negative' psychotic symptoms, such as social withdrawal, lowered the risk of serious violence.”

This other [meta-analysis focused on schizophrenia](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000120#s4) does also find an association between violence and schizophrenia, but the authors do point out that “\[t\]he relationship between comorbid substance abuse and violence in schizophrenia may be mediated by personality features and/or social problems, and is unlikely to be a simple additive effect”.

How impactful psychosis or schizophrenia as a risk factor are should also be stated with due nuance. As Douglas and colleagues found, “psychosis and violence are associated with one another, albeit with a small overall effect size”, and according to Fazel and colleagues, “\[i\]n those without substance abuse comorbidity, the risk of violent crime was modestly elevated with ORs ranging from 1 to 5. However, better adjustment for potentially relevant confounders and problems of misclassification (i.e., many of these patients may have undiagnosed and unreported substance abuse) would possibly reduce the observed risk”. In regard to reducing violent crime, [is tackling mental health under a risk assessment framework the best route](http://www.sentencingcouncil.justice.nsw.gov.au/Documents/Sentencing_Serious_Violent_Offenders/drolavnielssen-riskinschizophrenia.pdf), rather than other risk factors? (This is not to argue that mental health services shouldn't be provided, or that the system shouldn't be better, but for other reasons than framed under a criminal perspective).

Finally, if we add the issue of homelessness, there are other elements to consider that might affect interpretations. [For example](https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/appi.ps.201200515):

&gt;\[...\] homeless individuals with severe mental illness seem to be arrested more often than their stably housed counterparts. \[...\] this could reflect both a greater frequency of criminal behavior as well as the visible nature of the homeless life, which may make these individuals more likely to come into contact with the criminal justice system” and mental illness in of itself increases the risk of becoming homeless.

"No argument from me on that. I only mentioned it because it is, to my knowledge, the **only** scientific evidence that suggests **any** difference in ease of learning as an L1 for any language or group of languages. For that reason I was referring to L1 speakers of signed languages, not people who learn a few signs to supplement a different L1, which I thought was clear, but in fairness it probably isn't possible to talk about learning signed languages in early childhood without people seeing it through the supplemental lens.

"I agree with you on most everything. Your point that it might be dangerous for economists to decide issues of ethics and morality is well-taken, but I would counter by saying that they should be aware of those issues as well. Every economic policy shift has distributional outcomes, which makes them both political and brings in ethics. If those policy shifts are based on econometric models, then it behooves economists to be aware of what their models are recommending. I'd also add that economists are smart people and can learn that stuff as well; Adam Smith's ""Wealth of Nations"" was his second book, his first being ""A Theory of Moral Sentiments"" which was on philosophy, ethics, and morality. Basically, I think economists should be more well-rounded. They shouldn't be technicians. The thing they're dealing with is not an abstract machine, but is the material foundation for social organization and modern society. That's why economics is a social science, and any social science should be concerned with ethics. Analyses of social phenomena are concerned with how people interact, and that always involves questions of norms.

Regarding the split between the older tradition and modern economics, it's not that early on. If Smith is considered the father of econ (1776), the split began around 1880 and was finished by the mid-1930s, when the dive into math helped drive other economic approaches out of fashion. So the split was finished roughly 150 years after the field started, and it's been 80 years since the split. 

Behaviorial isn't explicitly about ethics and morality, but it has the potential to grow in that area. Its nudges are aimed at improving economic efficiency or helping maximize utility, but they could easily be aimed at social goals as well.

"It may not be exactly what you're looking for but I like Bowles parochial altruism theory. Bowles studied group formation and to have cohesive groups form in his models you needed a certain population of parochial altruists, people with high ingroup identification and belligerent outgroup behavior. Basically these are the agents that get everyone together to go fight the other groups. 

From the sounds of things your example breaks down pretty evenly along these lines. One of the interesting things is that when sub groups form they still have the same relative population of parochial altruists but this cohort has stronger and more extreme views than the group they split from. As such it can become a theory of radicalisation (I think Simon Dedeo has done some work along these lines).

&gt;Let us now consider the total value of the product, the 10 lbs. of yarn. Two and a half days’ labour has been embodied in it, of which two days were contained in the cotton and in the substance of the spindle worn away, and half a day was absorbed during the process of spinning. This two and a half days’ labour is also represented by a piece of gold of the value of fifteen shillings. Hence, fifteen shillings is an adequate price for the 10 lbs. of yarn, or the price of one pound is eighteenpence.

&gt;Our capitalist stares in astonishment. The value of the product is exactly equal to the value of the capital advanced. The value so advanced has not expanded, no surplus-value has been created, and consequently money has not been converted into capital. The price of the yarn is fifteen shillings, and fifteen shillings were spent in the open market upon the constituent elements of the product, or, what amounts to the same thing, upon the factors of the labour-process; ten shillings were paid for the cotton, two shillings for the substance of the spindle worn away, and three shillings for the labour-power. The swollen value of the yarn is of no avail, for it is merely the sum of the values formerly existing in the cotton, the spindle, and the labour-power: out of such a simple addition of existing values, no surplus-value can possibly arise. [13] These separate values are now all concentrated in one thing; but so they were also in the sum of fifteen shillings, before it was split up into three parts, by the purchase of the commodities.

"I will be referring to social psychological literature, especially to Tajfel and Turner's contributions (Social Identity Theory and Social Categorization Theory) to answer you ([example](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/053901847401300204)).

Firstly, I would suggest that it is important to understand that people have *multiple* identities at different gradients along the continuum between the individual identity and social identity. A person can identify themselves as member of a university, and as a member of a specific faculty, and a member of a specific curriculum, and these identities are salient/important at different times and contexts. And different identities are related with norms, values, elements to compare with others and on which to search for dissimilarity.

According to SIT, categorization motivates people to maximize intergroup distinction, and to show in-group bias (favoritism). Competition for resources (material or symbolic, such as self-esteem) fuel categorization and intergroup conflict. People have a need for positive self-esteem and a way to achieve that is to compare themselves to others. If group identity is positively valued, then self-esteem is also high.

There are also other advantages related to group identity, such as reducing uncertainty and to give a sense to things. Groups, such as political parties, provide norms, give answers to questions about values and morals, and what to do, how to react to events, etc.

At the best of my knowledge, there is no reason to argue that party affiliation, or any social identity, shouldn't be as strong as religious identity, ethnic identity, etc. if it provides the 'resources' people need and there is the context to make them salient.

[I'll end with this:](https://people.psych.ucsb.edu/sherman/david/hogg.sherman.2007.pdf)

&gt;One  implication  of  our  research  is  for  an  uncertainty reduction  analysis  of  extremism  (Hogg,  2004,  2005b).

"&gt;The history of economics has been more so put into Political Economics from my understanding. 

This is a trend that goes back to Marshall, and is lamentable. Every practitioner should know the history of one's profession; adding one course to 4 years of undergrad, 2 years of masters, or 5 years of phD is hardly a back-breaking requirement. And being exposed to those old ideas might help bring out new concepts and new analyses. The rise of mathematical econ was far from a natural progression of events, and if math is the only acceptable mode of inquiry, then things which can't be quantified get discarded (RIP the American Institutionalists, the Marxists other than as a fringe, etc).

"I don't think the point from Marx's perspective is that every bit of value goes and stays with the worker. Surely, in a system where the workers receive the surplus of their labor, they are then able to pay a wage for someone to fill an essential role that doesn't, in itself, create a surplus, but rather facilitates the whole operation.
In a standard capitalist system that wage is paid by the capitalist, in a system where the workers own the means of production this wage would come out of their profits.

"*In addition to the fact that it would demobilize that parties activists, like* /u/vincentstaples *already mentioned, because ""single-issue voters"" aren't really voting based on a single issue, they are using a single issue as a litmus test for ideology. If that test was taken away they'd just get another one.*

According to [Lau and Redlawsk (2006)](https://www.amazon.com/How-Voters-Decide-Information-Processing/dp/052161306X), single issue voters don't *really* care about only one issue. They just use politicians stance on some issue (i.e. abortion, marijuana, gay rights, etc...) as a heuristic for a specific bundle of other preferences. And it's effective too. For example, if I told you, ""I am pro-choice,"" would you be able to reliably guess my opinion on the Affordable Care Act, gerrymandering, medical marijuana, or Kavanaugh's confirmation?  You probably could make a pretty accurate guess. That's because my (hypothetical) support for women's choice is associated with my other preferences due to a phenomenon known as partisan conflict extension ([Layman and Carsey 2002](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3088434)).

&amp;#x200B;

*For example:*

&gt;I am Pro- choice.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pro-choice people are probably liberal.  
&gt;  
&gt;Liberals probably think X.  
&gt;  
&gt;Therefore: If I am pro-choice then I am probably a liberal.  
&gt;  
&gt;Therefore: If I am a liberal I probably think X.

&amp;#x200B;

People who are ""single-issue"" voters are really no less partisan than anyone else. Even ""independents"" predominantly vote for one party over the other ([V.O. Key 1966](http://wikisum.com/w/Key:_The_responsible_electorate), [Klar 2016](https://www.amazon.com/Independent-Politics-American-Political-Inaction/dp/1316500632/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1453067009&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=klar+and+krupnikov)). The only difference, according to Lau and Redlawsk, is that single-issue voters use a tiny-amount information in one key area and about only one candidate to determine if that candidate is sufficiently conservative or liberal (Republican or Democrat). Meaning: a Low-information, Low Comparability strategy.

Interestingly, low information voting was more effective at determining the candidate closest to the voters own naive-preferences than ""rational-actor"" strategy (high information, high comparability) for all but the most politically knowledgeable voters. Lau and Redlawsk suggest this is because voters don't know how to prioritize and process the huge amount of information available to them in the ""rational actor"" strategy. Voting for your party ID (low information, high comparability) was actually the most effective strategy for choosing the candidate that best matched their net preferences.

So what does this mean to your question? It means that if a party switched positions on, for example, abortion and the Democrats became ""pro-life"" then ""pro-life"" would stop being a useful proxy for ""Republican"" and those single issue voters would just select a different heuristic.

"1 - I am referencing the microeconomic model of the consumer and the assumptions of rationality (or rather, hyperrationality), and in particular how they fly in the face of the entire marketing process. People do not evaluate baskets of goods comparatively, and claiming their choices are transitive is honestly a bit laughable (really, all classical hypotheses are rather bad).

2 - I am saying that the usual way the above is justified is that taken in aggregate, people behave as if they were hyperrational. This usually ends up in a convenient handwaving of crucial aggregation steps (at least in the textbooks I've read). Refer to the work of Arrow, Sonnenschein, Mantel and Debreau.

If you have references to more advanced theory that tackles these problems, please do share. So far the theory I've seen straight up assumes GET as written. I have made no references to macroeconomic concepts in the above - I am mostly talking about aggregated supply / demand curves, consumer and firm models and price setting at equilibrium. I do agree that most of this extends to macro, but I think you'll agree that that is due to the fact that one of the main neoclassical projects has been a microeconomic founding of macro. 

Re: neoclassical v neoliberal - while I agree that yours is the correct terminology when talking with economists, as you say, neoliberal is a political term. The way neoclassical economic thinking has been weaponized by neoliberal politicians to support indecent policy proposals in the name of supposed rational thinking while masking strong ideological capitalist roots is troubling and exposing these ideas as what they are is, I believe, mandatory.

"While Bangladesh does have a large urban population, it is a more recently urbanized country. So a simplistic reading of Durkheim’s theory might predict that this kind of social control is strongest where families have a shorter history in the city. If an older generation grew up in the villages, they will bring those values with them, and may pass them on to their immediate offspring to a certain degree, despite the ways in which urban life tend to reduce social control.

Another concept from Durkheim is anomie, a kind of alienation and absence of social control. Aside from the urban vs. rural divide, Durkheim compared the different levels of anomie among followers of different religions. I’m not familiar with the research on this topic but would suspect that anomie is lower (social control is high) in Muslim societies. Whether religion is the cause or not is open to debate, but its a hypothesis to explore.

Bringing these two points together (recent urbanization and the influence of religion) is the concept of fundamentalism. Social control might intensify specifically in reaction to the individual freedom offered by urban/modern life. This may seem contradictory but it is a common pattern where modernization is rapid and uneven. The more some groups embrace new forms freedom, the more forcefully others might reject this.

"The premise is true.

According to Wright (in the Encyclopedia of Criminology and Criminal Justice), ""\[ï\]n the federal system, less than 8 % of convictions were obtained through guilty pleas in the early 1970s; that number rose inexorably through the decades to reach the current level, above 97 % (Wright 2005).""

"I've been following Boghossian on twitter for a while now and I can assure you he's  pretty sleazy, and definitely has some political agenda. His ties with Richard Dawkins are pretty revealing: they both have a clear/vocal anti-feminist stance, and Boghossian even used to brag about it on twitter. He is definitely not a left wing academic. This is so obviously a part of their plot. In fact, coming  up with a loaded term like 'grievance studies' is already a sign their goal isn't strictly academic. They just want to shut down academic debates employing non-academic means, and their goal is to create a moral panic around the social sciences. Don't get me wrong, these hoax attempts might be useful, and even entertaining. However, how we interpret their actual impact is what's being discussed here. The authors' interpretation is self-serving, their lame video is non-academic and highly demagogic. This hoax attempt tells us more about the broader culture wars, and how this kind of experiment can be weaponized, than about the legitimacy or validity of entire fields of knowledge. Again, the very fact they would come up with a loaded term like grievance studies, or even make their lame reaction video, clearly shows their ideological motivation. It's pure propaganda. Furthermore, Boghossian, like Jordan Peterson, also subscribes to the 'neo-marxist postmodernism' crap, iirc.

&amp;#x200B;

More to the point, considering  the amount of gross blunders, explicit frauds and even hoaxes that we find year after year being published in the so-called 'harder' sciences, if Boghossian spent so much time and effort rallying against physics  (say, for having an atheist agenda) or biomed or computer sciences,  etc... as he does rallying against other fields like gender studies ...  then I'm pretty sure he would be able to publish a couple of fraudulent  papers here and there ... and then say ""take that physicists!"".

All sciences have issues with peer review.

For those keen on dismissing entire fields of knowledge over supposed hoaxes and their imagined implications, here's a list of episodes when the process of peer review in the 'harder' sciences failed... should we dismiss those fields in their entirety too?

"The problem with your reply is here:

&gt; ... the state has infinite capital ...

The state doesn't have infinite capital. If it did we could live in paradise. Indeed, if any agent had infinite capital we could live in paradise because the state could tax them.

Let's take a situation like an old-style soviet country. The state own all capital. That doesn't mean that they have infinite capital, it's a lot but it's not infinite. Saving is still required if the state wants more capital. The state may command more investment goods to be built like ships or machine tools. But that must mean less of something else. The state must divert capital and labour in order to invest more.

So, the same things that apply to individual investors or to co-ops also apply here. Someone must wait for a return on investment to occur. In the case of a whole country everyone is part of that process. To put it another way: it's not that nobody is a capitalist, everyone is partly a capitalist.

You mention money, but money cannot create capital. Creating money is just a way of redirecting capital from one use to another.

The whole point of this sub-thread was to discuss Marxian exploitation. You said at the start that you could identify Marxian exploitation without the need for the labour-theory-of-value. Now, in this thread you've talked about a lot of things that are wrong in the world. But how does that answer our question? Which one of them corresponds to Marxian exploitation? How do we differentiate between a co-op making a return on investment and an individual doing the same?

"I don't know if this counts as ""cool"" but there's for example Theodore Sarbin who saw mental illness as a social construct, and who distinguished between ""role playing"" and ""role enacting"". 

The latter goes along with more internalization of the taken role (percieving it as reality).

Sarbin was also a supporter and advocate for the explanation of hypnosis as a social role enactment. There is a controversy in psychology about whether hypnotic trance is a distinct cognitive state or a social enactment between two people.

Another person would be Judith Butler, who (losely put) claimed that gender is a social construct, and that your gender is something that emenates from the social enactment of gender roles.

"A clear distinction between *moral panics* in general and the specific *satanic ritual abuse* moral panic has to be made. As explained by Greer and MacLaughlin in the *Oxford Handbook of Criminology*, moral panics have been created regarding several different topics - Moral panics are a consequence of media's ""power to shape crime consciousness"" by amplifying public anxieties and exaggerating an allegedly novel 'threat' compared to itself and/or other issues.

It is also important to distinguish between *moral panics* and *conspiracy theories*. Citing Cohen's *Folk Devils and Moral Panics*, something is a moral panic when some 'thing' (e.g. an episode, a group of people, etc.) ...

&gt;\[...\] emerges to become defined as a threat to societal values and interests; its nature is presented in a stylized and stereotypical fashion by the mass media; the moral barricades are manned by editors, bishops, politicians and other right-thinking people; socially accredited experts pronounce their diagnoses and solutions; ways of coping are evolved or (more often) resorted to; the condition then disappears, submerges or deteriorates and becomes more visible.

A conspiracy theory such as Pizzagate lacks, broadly speaking, conditions such as consensus by the public at large, the mass media, politicians, etc. and is not the result of the media blowing something out of proportions. Mass media does not need to have a predominant role for conspiracies to exist and take root.

When it is said that the satanic ritual abuse was a 1980s moral panic, scholars (in principle) are referring to the *specific* surge of reports of people ""alleging that they had been sexually abused as part of the ritual of secret, Satanic cults, which included torture, cannibalism and human sacrifice"" (citing Cohen), which were then proven largely false and died off by the 1990s. While admittedly there are still consequences of this moral panic and similar reports or case still appear on the news, it is not at the same *magnitude* or *propagation.*

There are still today moral panics regarding predatory pedophiles, however we don't have widespread media dissemination of dangerous satanic cabals of pedophiles engaged in arcane rituals. Rather, it's been replaced by, for example, [the dangers of Internet and sexual predators lurking everywhere online](http://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2152/1966#p8), which relates to your observation regarding shows like To Catch a Predator. It can be argued that the fears and anxieties related to pedophile priests are sensationalized and disproportionate (compare the results of this report by [John Jay College](http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/child-and-youth-protection/upload/The-Nature-and-Scope-of-Sexual-Abuse-of-Minors-by-Catholic-Priests-and-Deacons-in-the-United-States-1950-2002.pdf) to [how much attention scandals](http://www.pewforum.org/2010/06/11/the-pope-meets-the-press-media-coverage-of-the-clergy-abuse-scandal/) related to the Church get), even though there are real problems underlying the issue. Defining something as a moral panics *does not mean* that the cases are fictional.

To read about how moral panics come to be and what they are about, you can read the aforementioned Cohen's book, and/or [this article by Garland](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1741659007087270?casa_token=NW6Gg3b1qSMAAAAA:FuOyEizN9_U__NUdWh-wS7dnyvkW4w_b71_ocbdz05wTMFc1qLqoAd0-oXSswUPutRDxMjplDBdwJmE).

"&gt; You say that someone investing into an activity which increases production and a landlord investing in real estate to rent out are essentially the same. I take it that landlords are somehow improving the property over time or otherwise generating something of value then?

In my examples, I've talked about one off investments.  The one of purchase of machinery.  Or the one of purchase of a property to let out.  There isn't much difference between the two cases.

A machine provides services to people.  It performs a part of a production process.  A house provides the service of shelter and a few other things.

It doesn't matter in either case if the house or machinery is new or second-hand.

&gt; What is it? You take for granted that people need to be paid in order to not spend everything they have - why? There is no indication that people spend everything anyway.

It depends on your time-horizon.  I agree of-course that people will retain wealth over a short time horizon.  But this doesn't negate time-preference.  People still prefer wealth now to wealth later.  So, they will always spend some over time.  If you think about this is inevitable.  A person has to eat.  That means consuming goods now rather than later.

If there were no return to capital then all great fortunes would be eventually depleted.  There would be no new capital investment.

&gt; You claim that ""the effect the investment has"" is just another type of roi, but there is a pretty big difference between the two. It's the difference between capital as in money and capital as in machines and land and technology and things of value.

In all of my replies above I'm talking about *physical capital*.  Perhaps you would prefer it if I called it the ""means of production"".  Nothing I have written so far necessitates financial capital.

You may pay your landlord in money, but does that define your relationship to him?  If he asked you for a share of some crop you grow would anything be fundamentally different?

&gt; It's the same problem that the story on comparative advantage in international trade has: you cannot change machines into other Machines the same way you can switch around wealth - a production process needs to happen, and trades require buyers. See for example the rust belt in the US, or any other old industries. Why don't they just switch to producing something else? Because money and the means of production are not the same thing.

I agree that money and the means of production aren't the same thing.  What does this have to do with what I've written above?  (I also fail to see what it has to do with comparative advantage, but let's not get into that).

&gt; Also, if there is no return on capital the State will still have all the capital they can possibly need.

I'm not sure what you mean here.

The position of the state is just like the co-op in my example above.  Investment in capital requires sacrifice now by the citizens of that state.  It produces gains later.

&gt; Moreover, consider that the idea that everybody always consumes to the max all the time is kind of bogus when the amount of invested capital in Western societies is between 40 and 60% of total wealth. Savings exist.

I never said that ""everybody always consumes to the max"", or anything similar to that.  I agree that a large amount of wealth is invested in western societies.  That's because there is a return to investment.

&gt; Capital will still exist because money has intrinsic value as insurance, and because the state can run a deficit.

Yes, financial capital can exist without physical capital.  But, how is that relevant?  The contention you made above is that an owner of physical capital is exploiting you.

"&gt; Models will show whatever said model incorporates, this is tautology. It won't show you whatever isn't considered.

This is too broad. One one hand, there are unknowns that have no impact on your models, and criticizing this is like criticizing classical mechanics for not predicting car crashes on American interstates, or arguing why history is wrong because the historiography of Mayan civilization has no implications for Russian agriculture in 1900. This is why any professional develops multiple models, to consider what isn't considered in your other models.

On the other hand, you may be criticizing economics as a field for not being able to capture ""what isn't considered"". Well sure, as people trying to reason things out verbally, it's hard to consider all the effects. That's why we usually don't do things this way and use statistics and econometrics. If your effect doesn't show up, either 1) it's not in the model and outside the domain of analysis, so you should switch models, 2) you need to collect more data, or 3) the effect doesn't exist.

&gt; Mainstream economics as a whole does have massive epistemic blind spots, the largest being climate change and resource depletion.

You're confusing economic policy with economics as a field. Climate change and resource depletion are some of the most heavily studied subjects in economic theory, e.g. carbon pricing. Blaming the field of economics for policy not matching up is like blaming aerospace engineering for the Challenger explosion.

&gt; ""Optimal state planning"" in ""communist regimes"" was indeed very similar to finding ""equilibrium in a free market,"" precisely because these nation-states had markets, had capital, surplus-value, wage labor, and thus were obviously still subject to the law of value. They were 'communist' in name alone.

There's a ""not even wrong"" thing here. If you're trying to argue that politics is inextricable from economics, you shouldn't give an example where your ""law of value"" model of politics has no impact on which economic model you choose. As you say, since the underlying theory is generalizable to various political systems, the economic models apply anywhere, and thus one needn't consider political theory to do economics.

Alternatively, you're saying that politics is fundamental to economics. This is trivially true; economic models wouldn't hold if there were no people, and so long as there are people there will be politics. If you're expanding your notion of politics this far, then yes, economics does consider politics! There's political economics, as mentioned by the other commenter.

One more point, and more relevant, is that these models of ""capital, surplus-value, wage labor"" you mention are not the reason why central planning problems are similar to market equilibrium problems. The reason for the similarity is more or less the math of the optimization process, and not underlying political theory. A super simple example is linear programming, which during the Cold War was used in western firms' computations of production as well as the Soviet Union's computation of state resource allocation. I imagine modern economic methods are much more robust, but this is not my expertise.

"Are you familiar with the concept of falsifiability as it pertains to scientific hypotheses? You keep putting scare quotes around ""falsify"" so I'm not sure we're talking about the same thing here. 

Falsifiability of a hypothesis is required for it to be a scientific hypothesis, according to Popper. Polyvariate phenomena can be subject to falsifiable hypotheses, because theories about them only need to be falsifiable *in principle* in order to be scientific. Moreover, pretty much every phenomenon we study is ""polyvariate"" so it's no different from other hypotheses in that respect. Observing phenomena and then explaining them with a hypothesis, then seeing if that hypothesis stands scrutiny to other phenomena, that's just the scientific method.

My point is that cultural hegemony is just another scientific hypothesis.

"I think one has to differentiate between two types of ceremonies. Ones happening not in the context of total institutions and ones that happen within total insitutions. Case 1 being tribal rites etc., case 2 being military hazing, fraternities and so on. For case 1 I can recommend you the writings of Van Gennep regarding  rites of passage. 

For the second case I recommend Erving Goffmans ""Asylum"", where he examines this rituals.

His idea is that there are institutions that (ALWAYS to a degree) are organized along the lines of small staff and a lot of inmates, the former managing the lives of the later, working eating sleeping in the same place etc. Total instiutions are a heuristic, a sensitizing concept, not a tool for conclusive classification. You can look at barracks, boats, boarding schools, hospitals, monestaries and of course asylums through the lense of total institutions. What you find than is that the institution has as specific idea about the people within the institution. That identity is different from the so called civic identity (I think thats what Goffman called it in the original, but  I read a translation), the identity the person has before entering the institution. Now the rituals you asked about (at least in this organizational contexts) do a few things. First they take away markers of the civic identity: the people are stripped, given different clothing, shaved, given a number or a nickname and so on. This weakens the sense of their old identity to impose the new identity of the inmate, the patient, etc. What's interesting is, that violence is not neccesary for that, in the case of e.g. becoming a monk, where the same processes are at play. But when violence is used it does serve a practical purpose: forming a new identity, by weaking the old identiy, because usually the old identity also involved being someone who was/is not subjected to violence and also the organizational identity demands accepting violence.

"Some of your explanations of behaviorism aren't quite accurate:

&gt; The simplest explanation is that behaviorists believe that the human mind is a black box and that we should not waste time studying it, because we cannot actually ""see inside it"". Thus we can (or should) only care about the outcomes, the reactions, what we can actually see and measure directly: behavior.

Just note that this is only true of *methodological* behaviorism. Skinner argued against viewing the mind as a black box, and instead suggested that if we were to truly have a science of psychology then we needed to study the mind as well. His behaviorism was ""radical"" in that it brought the mind back to behaviorism. 

To make things more confusing, when Skinner argued that we should study ""behavior"", his concept of 'behavior' includes everything that an organism does - including cognition. So he doesn't think that we should just study external behaviors like pressing a button, but that we should study things like attention and memory, and other cognitive processes.

&gt;Thus, researchers such as Pavlov and Skinner were interested in studying human behavior and in explaining human behavior as reactions to conditioning, reinforcement, punishment.

To be clear, it needs to be noted that all the leaders of behaviorist movements were obsessed with biological explanations of behavior and rejected the idea that everything can be explained by conditioning. John Watson was an ethologist who studied innate behaviors most of his life, and in his book ""Psychology as the Behaviorist Views it"" where he outlined the principles of behaivorism as he saw them, he dedicated two chapters to the importance of understanding instincts. 

Skinner was similarly interested, with his concept of operant conditioning essentially being a head nod to Darwin's theories of natural selection (he even called operant conditioning ""selection by consequences"" to explicitly draw a link between the two). He also wrote multiple articles on phylogenic behavior (which is innate behavior). 

&gt;It lost popularity with the cognitive revolution, and I don't think there are (many) psychologists today that would fully commit to behaviorism (although that does not mean behavioral research is meaningless or valueless). Have an 
&gt; essay by Skinner
&gt;  on the topic.

The ""cognitive revolution"" didn't really change much as there's very little difference between cognitivism and the popular form of radical behaviorism, so today you'll find a number of cognitivists working in behavioral psychology and a number of behaviorists working in cognitive psychology.

"This is essentially one of the fundamental problems with economics. The discipline has been artificially constrained to the creation of supposedly ""empirical"" models, which flattens the vast complexity of the real world to quantifiable micro-units that are meant to act as stand ins for the whole economy. Unfortunately, the economy is far more complex than simple units like supply and demand can ever explain on their own. Putting an equal sign on an equation does not somehow mean that the equation itself has any value describing the real world. 

Marxist economics differs fundamentally. It is still empirically based, but it tries to consider capitalism as a social system that is inflected with myriad contradictions stemming from people's opposing class-based interests, and the fundamental characteristics of capitalism such as the need for infinite growth, ceaseless competition, and the state's role in the economy as an agent for those in power. This is a completely different type of analysis than neoclassical economics attempts to make, and thus doesn't use the same tools or frame their findings in the same ways that these economists do.

"I really think this is a bad answer. Here's why.

1) If empirical economics was ""so often"" wrong, it would show in the data by definition and economists would revise the model. I don't know what your conception of empirical economics is. The primary models taught in any economics PhD program are very rigorously developed and robustly supported, even by the standards of hard sciences, and show this in empirical literature. Maybe the more experimental models are wrong, but you get that in physics too.

Alternatively, maybe you're accusing economists as a whole of having some kind of epistemic blind spot. The only way I could convince you otherwise is to have you sit in several economics lectures, since we'd have to go through all of economics step by step, so to better facilitate your point you should be more specific about how economics is ""so often"" wrong. If it's going to be something like the 2008 recession, you should also try to explain why that means all of economics is wrong, since most of economics doesn't even pretend to deal with or predict housing bubble collapses.

2) Non-Marxist economics and political science already consider ideas of power. It's very different from Marx's class-based conception, but it does exist. I also suspect that it's much more rigorously supported, since as you say, economics is ""strongly 'empirical'"".

3) You can separate economics and politics. Optimal state planning in a communist regime is a very similar problem to finding an equilibrium in a free market. It doesn't matter what your politics are, the economics is the same. Well, mostly. Some economics is political, of course. But much of it isn't.

4) Marxists who actually studied economics typically utilize the modern economic framework in their development of neo-Marxian ideas, so I'm doubtful that ""a lot of Marxists would argue that economics is a bogus discipline"". Maybe a lot of Marxists who haven't studied economics believe that economics is bogus.

Moral foundations theory relates to this, suggesting that moral intuition is driven by idiosyncratic sensitivity to several widely recognized ""foundations"" of morality (care, fairness, respect for authority, loyalty to in-group, purity). A person's sensitivity to violations of the norms associated with these foundations influences their intuitive reactions, and contributes to an explanation of why people react to norm violations differently.

"Marx's analysis of contradictions of capitalism are all around social sciences. Marx's determinism that worker's will rebel in the crisis and put an end to class relations is largely refuted. 

Although there have been innumerable attempts to build on Marx, because he is so foundational, you can view his influence in two broad camps. One is trying to explain why the workers didn't revolt, and the other is updating the critique of capitalism and contradictions.

The former you can look to Antonio Gramsci and then the Frankfurt school, which looks as society and culture. This is the ""[superstructure](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Base-superstructure_Dialectic.png/1024px-Base-superstructure_Dialectic.png)"" that marx talked about. This became the [in its correct use] the study of cultural marxism, which eventually influenced more identity driven studies, such as marxist feminists.

On the ""structure"" side, I would argue Baran and Sweezy's ""Monopoly Capitalism"" was the big update. This looked at how corporations and monopolies change the structure, opposed to Marx's time where business was relatively small, numerous and more attune to the particular set of contradictions that marx laid out. For example, the pressure of wages can be mitigated with large and secure corporations--something used during the Keynesian eras. Still today our society rejection of marx leaves us unwilling to look at questions that are used to defend the free market like ""minimum wage only harms small business"". 

Today this has evolved into ""financialization"" (I think John Bellamy Foster was one of the first to popularize this), which allows for more flexibility and diffuses power (through a liquid asset--capital itself) necessary for neoliberalism and globalization.

This issue is that you can easily go through a social science career and never bother much with any of this. You will probably need or become somewhat familiar, but can choose to avoid the details. Marx was foundational to social science, but, unfortunately, it is kind of a sub-field of its own, and you won't always find him in name.

"I am familiar with the argument, but I remember it being associated with debates around capital punishment, such as this [Supreme Court case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_v._Louisiana) and [criticisms towards India](https://www.law.berkeley.edu/php-programs/faculty/facultyPubsPDF.php?facID=127&amp;pubID=20)'s introduction of the death penalty for rapists. In these cases the argument is that having death be the punishment for both rape and murder removes reasons to not murder a rape victim and/or provides incentives for murdering the victim to reduce the risk of identification.

Thus, it's not just a ""Reddit"" argument, but an argument made by law experts such as then [Justice Anthony Kennedy](http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/07-343.pdf): ""And, by in effect making the punishment for child rape and murder equivalent, a State may remove a strong incentive for the rapist not to kill his victim"".

Reasonable arguments if we apply, for example, [Rational choice theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory_(criminology)). There are, of course, specific cases of murderers who killed to eliminate a witness. However, is it the case that empirically there is a significant causal relation of this kind that applies to the general population of sexual offenders? I am not aware of studies and I doubt there are any about this specific topic, as it would require the ability to compare before-after and it wouldn't be ethical to test that.

To conclude, and generally speaking, the arguments against harsher punishments found in criminological literature are not built around the idea that harsher punishments give incentives for murder. Rather, it is about how ineffective it is for deterrence and how conventional punishment (such as prison) does not reduce recidivism. For capital punishment, there is no evidence that it deters murder. It might actually increase murder rates (as many scholars argue), via for example brutalization (the State gives an example to people that killing is an acceptable solution for certain problems).",NA,FALSE,NA,"Revue_of_Zero",NA,NA,1539096193,"t5_2sml9","t3_9mp387","t3_9mp387",2,1540859017,0,0,"e7gc8jp","AskSocialScience",NA,NA,NA

"There is no scientific evidence that *brainwashing* as commonly defined and depicted by pop culture (some sort of mind control or changing people's beliefs, opinions, etc. against their will) is an actual phenomenon.

[Citing from this article](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01100/full) about terms that are either misleading or should not be used in psychological literature:

&gt;**5) Brainwashing**. This term, which originated during the Korean War ([Hunter, 1951](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01100/full#B79)) but which is still invoked uncritically from time to time in the academic literature (e.g., [Ventegodt et al., 2009](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01100/full#B196); [Kluft, 2011](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01100/full#B92)),  implies that powerful individuals wishing to persuade others can  capitalize on a unique armamentarium of coercive procedures to change  their long-term attitudes. Nevertheless, the attitude-change techniques  used by so-called **“brainwashers” are no different than standard  persuasive methods identified by social psychologists, such as  encouraging commitment to goals, manufacturing source credibility,  forging an illusion of group consensus, and vivid testimonials** ([Zimbardo, 1997](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01100/full#B208)). Furthermore, there are ample reasons to doubt whether “brainwashing” permanently alters beliefs ([Melton, 1999](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01100/full#B134)).  For example, during the Korean War, only a small minority of the 3500  American political prisoners subjected to intense indoctrination  techniques by Chinese captors generated false confessions. Moreover, an  even smaller number (probably under 1%) displayed any signs of adherence  to Communist ideologies following their return to the US, and even  these were individuals who returned to Communist subcultures ([Spanos, 1996](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01100/full#B183)).

The scientific literature on *persuasion* is extensive and complex, which makes it hard to answer a broad question (the persuasion techniques I've put in bold above are but some techniques). It can be the topic of an entire semester of lessons. So I'll just briefly touch on the popular idea of subliminal messages controlling thoughts and decisions:

"Different kinds of homicide have different motivations and risk factors. Infanticide is not the same as femicide (the homicide of women, most often in the context of a relationship, which is one of the leading causes of female violent death). 

But *generally* speaking, the most common risk factors are (a couple of sources [\[one\]](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dustin_Pardini/publication/7378512_The_Prediction_of_Violence_and_Homicide_in_Young_Men/links/5703f3f108ae44d70ee05bb4/The-Prediction-of-Violence-and-Homicide-in-Young-Men.pdf?origin=publication_detail) and [\[two\]](http://www.rutgerscps.org/uploads/2/7/3/7/27370595/murderrisks.pdf): gang activity, being involved in drug trafficking, substance use, gun accessibility, being unemployed, being male, being young, having antecedents of violent behavior (violence tends to be a precursor to homicide), having been diagnosed for a disruptive behavior disorder, having been held back in school, low SES. [Weak self-control](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10940-004-1787-2.pdf) can also contribute to the risk of committing a murder. 

However, these risk factors should not be interpreted as is - there are interactions, such as poorer people living in worse contexts and thus having more opportunities to interact with gangs or not achieving good education. You might have been confronted with the issue of the over-representation of Black offenders, however their 'race' interacts with several other factors such as them being more likely to be disadvantaged socially and economically, living in worse contexts, etc:  ""Race was not included as a risk factor because it is more likely an index of exposure to a high degree of risk factors for violence, rather than representing a meaningful explanatory factor (Farrington &amp; Loeber, 2003)"".

Regarding context more largely (and this touches upon motivation), one of the reasons homicide rates might have fallen is [progress in medicine and reduced lethality of assaults](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10610-010-9130-y). After all, not all homicides are *intentional*. In the context of homicide committed by an intimate partner, it is often the result of abusive relationships. [According to this study,](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.93.7.1089) controlling partners are particularly dangerous, and an important trigger is the female partner leaving for another person.

Concerning rationalization of the act, that is more the realm of qualitative studies. Sykes and Matza suggested that criminals do employ [neutralizations techniques](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2089195) to justify their act to themselves and others (e.g. 'he deserved it', 'it wasn't my fault', 'he'll recover', etc.). Depending on the case, it is reasonable to expect murderers to employ similar techniques too, but I cannot provide you studies concerning non-serial murderers.

"I would approach that paper with a pinch of salt. Using official crime statistics for sexual abuse is problematic, as official trends can be misleading and is often more akin to a measurement of police work. Official rates can continue to increase while self-reported victimization is stable or declining. 

Discrepancies can happen because of increasingly less tolerance for sexual abuse, more awareness, etc. (and Scandinavian countries have seen a lot of push around the topic of sex offences), and/or because of changing police/prosecution/judicial policies (e.g changes in recording practices and taking reports seriously). And in the case of Norway (and other Nordic countries), there are issues concerning changes in legislation. Based on what I know, the authors understate the value of self-report data and overstate the value of police data. 

As [Tonry](http://www.antoniocasella.eu/nume/Tonry_2014.pdf) explains:

&gt;Since the late 1990s, sexual offenses in Scandinavian countries have received steadily increasing political and ideological attention (Skilbrei and Holmström, 2011, 2013). In both political debates and the media, crime discourse in Scandinavia is increasingly victim-centered and moralistic (Tham et al. 2011). The recent emphases on victims and on sexual offenses may have made victims and police more sensitive than in earlier times to minor kinds of invasive behavior, citizens more likely to perceive incidents as assaultive when answering victimization surveys and to report incidents to the police, and police more likely to treat them as offenses.

"I included platonic as well as romantic relationships that would fall under ""significant other.""  In retrospect I probably should have written ""enter into partner relationships with other women.""   Perhaps platonic should be omitted; maybe it confuses the matter.

&gt;On that topic, there is no significant evidence for a causal link between childhood abuse and same-sex orientation.

Perhaps the factor here is bisexuality.  And there are suggestions (I am not really versed in the topic) that fluidity in sexuality is greater than we suspect.

And aside from *child abuse* we have these two broad categories of mistreatment from men:  1) rape and sexual harassment (not from spouses) and 2) domestic violence (cited in OP).


So are there women who are Bi but never gave it much consideration, but then elect to end relationships with men after a succession of negative experiences (and engage with women)?  A significant number?

&gt;Sexual preferences are not set in stone and can change over time, often depending on the immediate situation the individual is in. This has been described as sexual fluidity. For example, if someone identifies as heterosexual but then finds themselves in an environment with only people of the same gender, they might feel increased sexual or romantic attraction to those same-gender partners.

"Apologies, I didn't mean my reply to be fiery. Only critical. Obviously you or any individual are not responsible for the present state of economics, so I'm by no means accusing you personally of anything.

I fully agree with you that mathematical economics has merit, and should not be abandoned. It has provided numerous insights, as has behaviorial even in the short time that behaviorial has existed. Neither method is ""wrong"" (at worst, the incorrect method / model is chosen to deal with a given problem).

My position, which I think you're agreeing with, is that economics needs a greater diversity of perspectives, the most important of which is a study of economic history and the history of economic thought. Marginalism, and its focus on tinkering around with the system to improve it, is a radical shift from the older political economy which was more concerned with explaining the system as a whole, and how best to improve it. As a result of that shift, modern economics has lost the older emphasis on issues of ethics, morality, and justice; those goals can't be quantified, so other than (contemporary!) concern about income inequality, those foundational questions - which are really why economics as a field of inquiry was invented in the first place - have disappeared completely. That makes modern economics, in my perspective, far less interesting than the older political economy. 

The realm of acceptable economic inquiry has shifted from the big, societal questions of Ricardo (What happens when land is scarce?), Smith (How do we improve the welfare of the state?), and others to ""How can we improve the marginal utility of an idealized utility-maximizing agent?"" Analyzing marginal utility is not a waste of time, and by no means should be abandoned. It just needs to be complemented with the bigger, society-wide questions which motivated the older economists, and the best way to learn those questions is to study the history of economic thought. 

I can't speak to behaviorial since I'm not expert on that area, but my general impression is that the impetus for forming behaviorial econ was to explain why utility-maximizing actors - the foundation of marginalist econ - failed to act in predicted, utility-maximizing ways. In that sense, behaviorial is more about the social component, but only because the social component explains the unexpected behaviors of homo economicus. So while behaviorial has its famous ""nudges"" to help people help themselves, the object of inquiry is still the individual, and the goal is to help maximize his utility. That said, as I pointed out, I'm not an expert here and could be completely wrong.

I would conclude by repeating what I said at the start - I didn't mean my critique as fiery, and tried to edit out potentially-inflammatory words. Apologies for that if I failed.

"A social movement is always comprised of people and real experiences in the real world, which ought to be subject to some kind of empirical study by virtue of being in the real world.

"I wanted to start my reply by thanking you for an engaging and polite discourse. I've enjoyed our conversation and think that even though we might come from somewhat different fields we are able to discuss the similarities fairly well.

&gt;Totally agree! If they genuinely cared about the health of these fields, there are much better ways to go about trying to critique and move the them in new directions. Their ""hoaxes"" utterly fail on that front.

At the risk of beating a dead horse that we really seem to agree on, the stance  all my criticisms come from is that once a possible flaw in our system is exposed, we should take it seriously and work toward it. Science is slow, scientific revolutions are slow (Thomas Kuhn is amazing though), but I think we can speed methodological and process advancement up a bit if we take scenarios like this, fraudulent data, p-hacking, and general poor methodological practices seriously

&gt;While I don't doubt that this happens, I also think there is room for interpretation/re-interpretation in a lot of social theory. And, of course, there's no way to include *everything* in an introduction, especially given space limitations. If people in your field are leaving out stuff you think is important in their work, you (and others who agree with you) should take them to task in the literature for it. That's how this is all supposed to work, right? We assume a good faith effort on the part of our colleagues, which is why this ""hoax"" was particularly stupid, because it uses those of us engaging in good faith efforts to improve scholarship to try to shit all over any social sciences and humanities that engage with critical studies of gender, race, and sexuality.

&amp;#x200B;

Definitely agree with you. It is a group effort and I think we can all do a better job, myself included. I saw something recently about bringing AI to research and it made me think how much better an intro could be if the lit review was actually exhaustive, but like you said we have space and reader attention limitations.

I do think that we might need to consider whether science can exist in the ivory tower any longer or if we need to accept that our research can and is interpreted and extended by people with agendas. The same journals we submit to could be exploited in bad faith (I'm reluctant to say these authors were acting in bad faith because they may have thought this was a necessary body of ""research""), but even if its not pure malice there is room for questionable writing practices (cite me if this becomes the next ""questionable research practices""!) to impact our fields. If something that is pure garbage can make it in, then things that are pretty close but not right certainly do.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Why is this a problem? Can social phenomena not have multiple potential explanations? I guess I'm struggling to see why multiple theoretical frameworks explaining the same phenomena in different ways is a problem.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think it is completely problematic, but I think it shows room for improvement. The ability for a hoax to be written using pieced together papers suggests to me that there wasn't a rock solid framework there because the editors and many of the reviewers didn't immediately flag the papers.

 I agree that social phenomena are complex and multifaceted. In fact, I would argue that most social behaviors are not from a single source of influence. However, I think that in order to fully develop the social sciences we will need to start operationalizing multiple theories in the same study and putting them into the same models in ways that let us differentiate which theories are better explanations under specific scenarios. Otherwise it seems like we will just always end up in a state of ""well, the big 5 personality would be impactful too!"" and ""what about race and gender?"". Certainly those examples can and do work together, but my critique is that people often don't model it (note: race, gender, and the big 5 definitely get put into the same model all the time that was an easy example off the top of my head without actually calling out any specific papers). In a dream scenario, we would be able to explain 100% of the variance in human behavior and it would certainly take a ton of theories to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Why? What is the benefit of a very narrow framework? For example, how would a very limited theoretical framework be beneficial for explaining gender, sexual, and power dynamics? (Not to mention the authors really did not use Butler's performativity theory properly, which to me is a failure of peer review, not of Butler's framework.)

I want to emphasize here that I did not read the hoax papers and am not fully familiar with much of the work that they wrote about. I think that your mention that they didn't use the theory properly aligns with my general stance. If the misuse of a theory can slip through even one reviewer, that makes me think the system needs some work. Maybe it means we need to change the review system (we do) and maybe it means we need to make theories more defined (I think we do).

I don't think the framework has to be very narrow. However, I think that there are benefits to having theories defined enough for us to know what to expect under specific circumstances. These things are iterative and likely intersectional so I am sure there will be times that we need to revise even the most well defined of theories. 

&gt;No, why should it? I appreciate that there is a diversity of approaches to explaining social life. I think that social phenomena often do not have a singular cause, so having multiple theoretical frameworks to explain (or interpret) them is useful. Of course, I favor some kinds of frameworks over others, but that's because I think they do a better job at explaining whatever it is I am studying. Those frameworks won't necessarily work in all contexts, and that's fine.

I think we have a similar stance here. The thing that might differentiate us is that I want the favoring of some frameworks over others because they do a better job of explaining the phenomena to work its way into the theories more obviously. If we think that power dynamics is a better predictor than intergroup relations in a given area , then I think we should pit the two against each other by operationalizing the two in different ways and seeing which is consistently better in models. If we can't operationalize the two differently to test this, then I would be left thinking that we have too many theories that are actually very similar to one another and just using different names (i.e., the jangle fallacy, god I love that term).

&gt;I do agree with you that people developing pet theories or dedicating themselves to a single theoretical approach can be problematic. Something I struggle with now is how pervasive Foucault is in medical anthropology. He's useful for explaining some stuff (like larger structural issues), but I don't find him useful at all for examining day-to-day interactions in clinical settings. I find myself having to push back a lot against reviewers and interlocutors who insist upon centering Foucaultian theory. That's all to say, I'm not trying to paint a picture that all is well in theory land, but I think these problems (as you note) are to be addressed from within the fields and bad faith attacks from outside won't do much good on that front.ity theory properly, which to me is a failure of peer review, not of Butler's framework.)

This is an area where I wish I knew more outside of my own research. I can certainly relate to selecting one theory over another because it is better at explaining the micro than the macro though. I definitely agree with you that it's not the end times and I'm happy to hear that you you agree not all is well. I've seen very uncivil exchanges discussing the need (or lack thereof) of methodological reform and the existence (or lack thereof) of a replicability ""crisis"". When researchers can't talk broadly about fields and ways we can strive to improve them it is pretty troubling. If it takes some bad faith attacks from outside to get the ball rolling, that is unfortunate and I agree likely to be less beneficial. However, people weren't really doing much with replicability in my area prior to Stapel getting caught making everything up and Bem having a paper accepted that suggested we had the capacity for ESP (in good faith from what I have always heard) in spite of questionable research practices (that were and still are the norm). This hoax is likely a one off and won't spur any sort of revolution, but I think it highlights some of the ways the system is flawed.",NA,FALSE,NA,"friendlyintruder",NA,NA,1539573440,"t5_2sml9","t3_9noxmp","t1_e7s8jhh",0,1541061625,0,0,"e7sde5l","AskSocialScience",NA,NA,NA

"A brief reply to the last question, which is the only one I believe is fully pertinente to this subreddit. What social sciences can do (ostensibly should do) is research, research, research. To determine which are the [risk factors](http://www15.uta.fi/arkisto/aktk/projects/sta/Verlinden_Hersen_Thomas_2000_Risk-Factors-in-School-Shootings.pdf) that might significantly contribute to people becoming school shooters (and which are not worth focusing much on, such as [media violence and video games](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jcom.12129) and [mental illness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318286/?utm_source=Yahoo&amp;utm_medium=Beauty&amp;utm_campaign=kirstie-alley-las-vegas-shooter-stephen-paddock-psychiatric-medications)), whether school shooters fit a certain profile ([not really](https://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/preventingattacksreport.pdf)), evaluations about effective prevention practices (does adding metal detectors, more guards, etc. work?), and so on.

Research is required to figure out empirically what works or could work and what could be done with the appropriate policy. There is unfortunately the issue about whether and to what extent politicians in the United States take into account research, especially regarding these topics. There is a [push by certain scholars](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-9133.2010.00666.x) for greater engagement by academicians with wider publics, to influece policy outcomes with evidence.

I will end by noting that research is also important to evaluate the extent of the problem and how widespread it is. There is a current issue with definitions (there is no clear consenus on what should be considered a school shooting), compounded by the structure of the USA (as a country with both federal, state and local agencies with different data, etc.). Greater mediatization also muddies the water, because greater awareness of an issue does not mean it has actually increased. [This researcher](https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/fifty_year_review_1.1_0.pdf) suggests the number has actually increased, but also concedes that ""it is possible that these results are skewed due to more recent events being better documented"".

"The crucial aspect of both questions is, how we define financial literacy, and in addition imply a normative end where this should lead. Vester et al. 2001 have shown - at least for Germany (I think Bourdieu has done something similar for France) - that groups associated with 'low financial literacy' in the bourgeois definition of the term have indeed their own financial literacy, aimed at normative ends related to their live-world. This is not a direct answer to your question but a commentary on and inquiry in your implied assumptions about higher financial literacy (defined how / by whom?) making society better (to what/whoms standart?).

Addressing your second question: No, I don't think so. The crucial element of the question is the word ""intenionally"" and how you understand it. Intention is something human and more over something attributed to the actions of individuals (compare Alfred Schütz 1967). So societies are not designed by one specific human actor. Societies always have historic a priori, a specific past, and the change from that is the outcome of quite a few individual and collective actors, different structures and procedures etc. all trying to influence each other, and the actual outcome being something different to all the intentions involved (compare for this model of change Michel Foucault's Birth of the clinic).

"Thanks for the response. I was even thinking about the example of 'vaccines cause autism' with regard to this. I laugh at people who believe that, but what do I really know? I know that a supposedly flawed study came out suggesting a link, and that then many follow-up studies found nothing, including a massive study of studies.

But do I even know that much? It's what I heard, but did I actually seek out and personally read those studies? Do I have the expertise to recognize flaws in those studies? No, I didn't, and I don't. So what do I really know?

So even with something that supposed to be that supposedly 'duh', how can I be sure I'm on the right side of it? With that specific example, at least you have a negative consequence to being wrong (unvaccinated children dying and spreading disease to others) that demands a high burden of proof to the claim. Similarly, with climate change, if there's even a small chance that the consensus is right about the potential damage, that still needs to deeply concern all of us, because we only get the one planet and can't afford to be wrong. 

But with other issues it's trickier. I used to be a big Milton Friedman fan. I still love to hear him talk, and crush people with logic. I don't think he's entirely correct anymore, but how do you deal with someone with skills on that level, who seems to be promoting critical thinking, being potentially wrong?

The research, as far as I've read, is really mostly just focused on the onset's impact.

Finals can also affect contour, but usually more in terms of laryngeal features like a final -h or final glottal stop.

"&gt; Just because economic prejudice treats explaining prices as the raison d'etre of theory does not grant you the right to erase Marx's analysis of value and substitute it for cost.

The whole point of the LTV is to link the two. There is no point in adding up all the ""socially necessary labour time"", unless it produces something. Marx tells us that the SNLT can say things about prices and profits.

&gt; ... the value determining factors of production - constant capital (machinery, raw materials) and variable capital (labour)).

I know that Marx distinguishes between constant capital and variable capital. But, he grounds constant capital in labour too. That's invalid because there are other inputs.

"Desire for sex is obviously biological. I don't think I have to provide a source for that.

Here's [a paper](http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-18048-001) about ""baby fever"":

&gt; Baby fever—a visceral physical and emotional desire to have a baby—is well known in popular culture, but has not been empirically studied in psychology. Different theoretical perspectives suggest that desire for a baby is either superfluous to biological sex drives and maternal instincts, a sociocultural phenomenon unrelated to biological or evolutionary forces, or an evolved adpatation for regulating birth timing, proceptive behavior, and life history trajectories. A series of studies (involving 337 undergraduate participants and 853 participants from a general population Internet sample) found that: (a) a simple scale measure could elicit ratings of desire frequency; (b) these ratings exhibited significant sex differences; (c) this sex difference was distinct from a general desire for sexual activity; and (d) these findings generalize to a more diverse online population.
