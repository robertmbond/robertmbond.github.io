&amp;#x200B;

Lots of tribal groups have coming of age ceremonies that are extremely painful or otherwise unpleasant. [There's an amazon tribe where people stick their hands in bullet ants.](https://sites.psu.edu/mgeitnerrcl/2013/11/16/satere-mawe-initiation/) The Masai send their young men to kill a lion with a spear, which sounds pretty dangerous and scary. I know there's lots more examples of coming of age ceremonies that are fucking terrifying.

&amp;#x200B;

Fraternity initiations often involve putting pledges through all kinds of bizarre and humiliating shit. Lots of sports teams and marching bands have had hazing scandals.

&amp;#x200B;

Military boot camp and later training obviously has a practical purpose, but many of the others here don't. Hazing that doesn't have an obvious practical purpose is also pretty common in the military.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a pattern at all? It seems like a lot of human groups require you to go through some bad shit to become a full member. What is the reason for all of this?

&amp;#x200B;

I also know there are some groups that do not require this. Christian Baptism or Confirmation don't require anything torturous. Why do some groups, but not others, have this pattern?

We act as though if gender and the ideas of masculinity and femininity are objective, tangible things that have a set definition.

I can see a big problem though in trying to define gender, because there are a handful of exceptions that make a concrete, objective definition tough to support. For the most part, gender seems to be tied to sex and appearance, but neither of those things are really gender themselves. And, given the variation within what we consider male and female, it’s hard to say that gender has a singular trait that defines it. Gender and sex are distinct, but by uncoupling the two, we create problems. I don’t think we can answer whether or not there are more than two genders or effectively solve any other gender-related issues like pronoun stuff until we can actually solve these problems.

Some people have argued that gender is not objective at all, but stems from the mind. In this view, gender is how you view yourself, and doesn’t have to be tied to anything apparent or biological. However, this definition is purely subjective, and doesn’t accurately describe how gender works in real life. Gender is referred to as “socially constructed,” which means that it logically can’t be an individual mental thing. Gender is also strongly tied to sexual orientation, suggesting that any useful, realistic definition of gender HAS to reference something tangible. I think observation of society shows that “assuming” someone’s gender ISN’T a bad thing, or maybe isn’t a thing at all; society uses gender in reference to social and cultural ideas that are tangible and visually apparent. Reality shows that gender is much more than an internal feeling or identification.

The best I’ve been able to say is that gender represents a set of characteristics that are the basis for sexual orientation, and that you know it when you see it. I don’t have a problem with people asking to make an exception to these rules (like saying, “I use they pronouns” if you look female), but I do have a problem with people trying to significantly alter or abolish the rules (like the idea that we need to normalize asking rather than assuming gender; I think gender exists to be assumed if you analyze what it exists).

So, questions:

- Is there a definition of gender? Is gender objective or subjective?
- How does gender relate to appearance, sex, and identity?
- What are the different sociological theories of gender and how do they propose gender to work?
- Are gender frameworks inherently oppressive to those who deviate? I think the binary model works really well in general, and it’s possible to allow people to reject it if they want while keeping its general structure of two primary genders.
- Can we think about gender in a way that respects people’s individual expression, but is also useful and realistic? (I don’t think the “gender = mind gender identity so don’t assume” model is at all accurate for society at large)

Is this a vindication of Locke’s tabula rasa theory?","I heard this in episode I of the 3rd season of NPR’s psychology podcast *Invisibilia*. They interviewed a psychologist of emotion who says that the new scientific consensus on emotion is that the emotions we feel are based on interpreting internal bodily processes based on the concepts of our culture, so for example what we feel as anger is basically a name we have learned to pin on the feeling of various hormones being released. Her evidence for this is derived from both neuroscience and anthropology. The podcast also mentions that people who gain sight as adults take years to actually see the same things everyone else does because their brain has no circuits for relating patterns of light, dark, and colour to abstract concepts. So for example someone who knows perfectly well what a circle and square feel like can look at both of them and have no idea which is which. It then extends this idea to other things, like how our politics influence the way we see the world and how pernicious stereotypes are.

To me it seems like the idea that there is constant ongoing ritual child sexual abuse, and shadowy rings that perpetrate it in a coordinated way, has become a pretty accepted thing in popular and political culture in a way that seems linked to the panics of the 1980s. The pizzagate conspiracy theory is an obvious parallel, as are (more controversially maybe) some fears around child sex trafficking, societal fascination with pedophilia media like To Catch a Predator, etc.

Is anyone aware of research attempting to understand this as a kind of decades-long moral panic related to children, sex, and abuse?

More specifically, I am interested in any literature which addresses whether similar policies proposed or enacted by differently worded legislation are associated with different levels of support for the legislation or discourses observed in legislative and public debates about the legislation.
 
To be clear, by 'differently worded' I do not mean whether certain provisions are included or excluded, or if a change in wording has an obvious material effect on the function of the policy. Rather, I mean a situation where the effect of the policy is constant but there are variations in the particular words used (or not used) and their order in the text of the legislation. Example:

* Wording 'A': Any citizen at or above the age of 18 may vote in elections.
* Wording 'B': Any non-citizen or citizen younger than 18 years of age is prohibited from voting in elections.
 
The difference between examples A and B is not the effect of the policy--both place constraints on voter eligibility with respect to citizenship and age--but the explicit and implicit categories are switched between A and B (where A is *explicit about who can vote* and *implicit about who cannot*, B is the opposite).
 
I've heard that different wordings of ballot initiatives and referendums can affect voters' choices, but this is not quite what I am after. I am more interested in knowing about the effects of wording in the context of bills introduced and acted upon in legislatures. To break my inquiry down into a set of smaller questions:
 
1. Do legislators know and care about the specific wording of legislation?
2. Does a differently worded policy produce a different debate in the legislature?
3. Do legislators have to know and care about the wording of the bill in order for there to be different levels of support or arguments used in the debate? Or can variations in these dependent variables occur without legislators being conscious/caring of the particular text of the proposal?
4. Repeat questions 1 through 3, but substituting the general public for legislators.

Edit to Add: I am of course happy to receive any replies which summarize the literature in their own words, but if you haven't the time or energy I am equally appreciative of a simple list of citations/links. Thank you!

Edit 2: Changed the example to something hopefully more accurate to my intended meaning. Previous example:

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some of the presented theses with the links to the articles attached:

&gt;That dog parks are rape-condoning spaces and a place of rampant canine rape culture and systemic oppression against “the oppressed dog” through which human attitudes to both problems can be measured. This provides insight into training men out of the sexual violence and bigotry to which they are prone. [link](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0966369X.2018.1475346?journalCode=cgpc20#aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGFuZGZvbmxpbmUuY29tL2RvaS9wZGYvMTAuMTA4MC8wOTY2MzY5WC4yMDE4LjE0NzUzNDY/bmVlZEFjY2Vzcz10cnVlQEBAMA==)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That it is only oppressive cultural norms which make society regard the building of muscle rather than fat admirable and that bodybuilding and activism on behalf of the fat could be benefited by including fat bodies displayed in non-competitive ways. [link](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21604851.2018.1453622#aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGFuZGZvbmxpbmUuY29tL2RvaS9wZGYvMTAuMTA4MC8yMTYwNDg1MS4yMDE4LjE0NTM2MjI/bmVlZEFjY2Vzcz10cnVlQEBAMA==)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That it is suspicious that men rarely anally self-penetrate using sex toys, and that this is probably due to fear of being thought homosexual (“homohysteria”) and bigotry against trans people (transphobia). (It combines these ideas into a novel concept “transhysteria,” which was suggested by one of the paper’s peer reviewers.) Encouraging them to engage in receptive penetrative anal eroticism will decrease transphobia and increase feminist values. [link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12119-018-9536-0)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That men frequent “breasturants” like Hooters because they are nostalgic for patriarchal dominance and enjoy being able to order attractive women around. The environment that breastaurants provide for facilitating this encourages men to identify sexual objectification and sexual conquest, along with masculine toughness and male dominance, with “authentic masculinity.” The data are clearly nonsense and conclusions drawn from it are unwarranted by it. (NB. One reviewer did raise concerns about the rigor of the data) [link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-018-0962-0)

&amp;#x200B;

At the end one of the conclusions made was:

&gt;Based on our data, there is a problem occurring with knowledge production within fields that have been corrupted by grievance studies arising from critical constructivism and radical skepticism. Among the problems are how topics like race, gender, sexuality, society, and culture are researched.

As well as:

&gt;Worse, the problem of corrupt scholarship has already leaked heavily into other fields like education, social work, media, psychology, and sociology, among others—and it openly aims to continue spreading.

And:

&gt;Our recommendation begins by calling upon all major universities to begin a thorough review of these areas of study (gender studies, critical race theory, postcolonial theory, and other “theory”-based fields in the humanities and reaching into the social sciences, especially including sociology and anthropology), in order to separate **knowledge-producing disciplines and scholars** from those generating constructivist sophistry.

&amp;#x200B;

I bolded the part that I want to ask about, because I felt like this implied that the research itself being done similarly to how they described their fake methods (interviews, observation, etc.) are not a valid forms of research. I wanted to ask this sub, because this study did imply corruption in the social sciences and wanted to know if my concerns are valid or not.

The question regards the contrast between stages 3 and 6. 

A social-psyche treatment looks at stage 3 as the moral reasoning character of 'conventional society', while the form of moral reasoning seen at stage 6 is a distinctly different worldview. 

Cultural norms are taught and maintained at the formal level of logical complexity. see: [Commons MHC](https://www.learning-theories.com/model-hierarchical-complexity.html) 

Stage 3 conventional society happens at a formal level of logical complexity. 

---------

&amp;nbsp; 

The issue here is that I expect many social scientists to have differing opinions on what is or should be considered 'normal' for conventional society. 

Even you're not familiar with the Kohlberg model you can understand that some people are more adherent  to a pro-social emotional repertoire than others, and also some people are more adherent to a strict interpretations of sentence logic. 

Kohlberg's stage 6 profile is scalable in complexity, but when it's at a higher level than formal, it's distinctly a very different form of logic.  

One who has a pro-social emotional repertoire, adheres to strict interpretations of sentence logic, has an understanding of development stages, and how the ranges of moral reasoning are transmitted within the social order, has a unique perspective on a 'bigger picture' gestalt.  


---------

&amp;nbsp; 

With all that context, the questions become: 

##When do you consider society is moral enough?  

##When do you consider society is not moral enough? 

##Why should we trust people who maintain a relatively systemically violent culture (ex: school shootings/militarism) to serve the psychological needs of the people?

Hoping some folks from the Sociology of Work/Labor, Business, Org Psych, etc. world can help with this.

I'm trying to find research that looks at how new business functions emerge and are then adopted (e.g., marketing, data science, user experience). My theory is that this often happens first through consultancies and then as trust builds (and the commodification of process takes over?), these functions start to move in-house.  Would love to see if that dynamic has been studied in other disciplines. 

Just wondering if anyone knows of some good literature or references on this or similar, adjacent topics.

Thanks!

Last year I started taking singing lessons. At first I debated with my teacher, and was skeptical about certain ideas she was claiming about singing and singing technique. I had heard different from so many different sources. 

After much debate, discussion, and just generally a year-long learning process, I now feel I have a solid handle on what is legitimate advice, backed up by study and evidence, and what is nonsense. Turns out, most of the 'singing teachers' on YouTube who have the most hits and subscribers? Yeah, they're full of it. 

You can find good knowledge, like [this guy](https://youtu.be/yNjF-F_3qvo), for example, and if you listen to him and compare him to the flashier and more exciting videos of those he criticizes, you can see part of the problem. And of course just look at his view count compared to those others as well.

So, my point is that it took me this decent chunk of time, effort, and desire for truth to be able to get to a place where I can spot the legit from the fake *in some section of a field of study I already have a degree in!* How is there hope for others who are completely uneducated to be able to do the same? Or for me to do the same in another field, like physics, or economics, or climate science?

This seems to be an incredibly deep problem where we live in a world where we're dependent on expertise, but left without ways of telling legitimate expertise from illegitimate hackery. We can't expect everyone to read and digest the climate studies at the level an expert in the field would. So how are those people supposed to tell? A PhD doesn't guarantee someone isn't full of it. Seeing them cite a study or use charts/graphs is far from full-proof. Majorities certainly aren't always right either. So what can you do? Are there any solid methods of determining these things, or at least determining who is *probably* correct, without knowledge in a given field?

How come they are often ignorant of commoner stuff?","I notice when many book smart people who profess knowledge of foreign cultures memorize all sorts of really intricate stuff from the proper poetic grammer of speaking the language at its most educated and eloquent levels to the dress styles and types of clothing that is often deemed as ""traditional"" to folk music and dances and religious custom. Basically they learn much of the complexities of a culture........ But on its most traditional and conservative. I note though much of them are so ignorant on what more specific stuff like how Tokyo has different mannerisms due to its congestion and heavy work life compared to say Kyoto. Worse yet they are even more ignorant of whats mainstream in the foreign culture they have so much knowledge about especially what the average Joe does in daily life an more importantly what a random commoner does and enjoys on a day-to-day basis (especially when you take into account social classes, regions, subcultures like Otakus, even differences in one neighborhood block from another and minor disasters thathappen in a small apartment block such as murders, explosions, etc).

To use as an example while most Hispanists and other scholars and lovers of Latin America would be able to explains the dances of Peruvian Indians or the major economic trends of Ecuador in the 90s and how the Federalists won the Mexican Revolution of the 20th century, they are quite ignorant of how Saint Seiya took Latin America by storm especially Mexico and was overall the most beloved anime/manga in the continent especially in Mexico (where it singlehandedly launch the popularity of anime/manga in the country and still remains a beloved childhood memory and most popular classic in the country). Saint Seiya along with DBZ and Sailor Moon were practically everything any kid with a television watched every Saturday and everyday once reruns began and merchandise sold like Twinkies for much of the 90s. Its almost impossible to see an adult with an average childhood who grew up in the 90s who had not watched all those 3 shows once. At the minimal even someone who didn't grow up with TV from the commoners stock at least can recognize one of those anime because of everyday conversations at school.

Another example is how history books on 90s Britain barely mention anything about soccer and only list stuff such as Margaret Thatcher not running another term and terrorist attacks, etc. In particular the comment about Thatcher amused since they often write about how relieved the British populace was about Thatcher not running another term. I lived with my mom at various points in the UK during the 90s and trust me most people in the city I lived in in Scotland was not cheering or holding parties, etc. In fact most people at the bar or in the playgrounds, etc were more concerned about just going on in their daily lives. I heard much more conversation about local farm profits, beer, the diseased sheeps, college sports, etc than anything about Thatcher, terrorist attacks, Arafat's visit to Britain shown on the news (I was there when I saw the meeting and discussions,), and the construction of the Millennium Dome. Only even I remember that shooke veryone in my town was the death of Princess Diana and even that was forgotten shortly after despite how news Media kept talking about it for months after she died.

There are too many examples to list from how the cinema of Turkey is rarely discussed by Turcophiles to the daily junk food Greeks commonly eat (especially beloved brand chips) or how Israel as its share of underground computer gaming scene that paid more attention to FPS tournaments than what was happening during the brief invasion of Lebanon. How can so many fans and experts of foreign countries and exotic cultures memorize the details such as how traditional hats are made but ignore that most people spend more time just chilling in their own favorite hobbies such as the local Rap scene or their own Americanophile groups who spend more time watching American movies than reading their country's classic literature and studying traditional dances? How can they not be aware of the most popular soap opera in Russia despite the fact they can pay attention to what's Putin is doing and memorize facts of various major cities and regions in Russia? While we're at it how come none of them ever bother memorizing the local villages and less significant cities of Russia, something that Russian themselves would know especially surrounding towns and city near a Russian's home? Or of the most recent top 20s in Algeria's music chart?

Can anyone explain this of why people with philia and/knowledge of a foreign country or another culture memorize traditional stuff mostly forgotten or barely known by the general populace such and major events like terrorist attacks in Ireland that most Irish people don't know about (and even those who saw it live on the news when it was happening had already forgotten about)?

I use Zotero to organize my citations. I've been working on a literature review and I have manually put together a list of about 100 publications, all organized in Zotero. I would like to find some software that would generate a network map of citations within this pre-existing, provisional bibliography I'm working on so I can get a better idea of the foundational works my lit review is relying upon and see if there's anything I'm missing.

Zotero can output the bibliographic information in a number of formats including BibTex, COins, CSV, XML and RIS among others.

Men's persistently poor behavior toward women is a generalization, but based on the widespread sentiment this past year from the MeToo movement, there is much basis for it.

And looking back in history, one can further generalize that whatever men's shortcomings have been in the past 4-5 decades, the situation was infinitely worse in many if not most places of the world pre-1900.

Excerpt:

&gt;It is only recently that domestic violence has been considered a violation of the law. Although men have battered, abused and mistreated their wives or intimate partners for a long time, historically, wife or partner abuse has been viewed as a ""normal"" part of marriage or intimate relationships....

&gt;The English common law, in the name of the protection of the family, provided husbands the right to chastise their wives only ""moderately"". It excluded death (Blackstone, 1987, p. 177). The English law, which was brought to the American colonies, allowed husbands to retain their right to physically chastise their wives, as long as they did not use a stick larger than their thumb (the origin of the expression ""the rule of thumb"").

Thinking back to my youth and comparing it with the possibilities of the youth today, I realized that back then we got our ideas and inspirations pretty much from our circle of friends and acquaintances and to a much lesser degree from articles in newspapers, magazines and TV. Those articles and the shows we watched on TV were *either* entertainment *or* news, and nobody doubted that the news reported facts and the articles were well researched by journalists who followed a journalistic code.

Today the landscape is different. Entertainment and news are mixed, officials say that the media isnt trustworthy and anybody who can type makes a blog. In short, the information that is circulated is blurred, in the net journalists are competing with political activists and conspiracies. At the same time, everybody has access to things like wikipedia and scientific papers, and trending culture is trending everywhere without being localized to your city, for example.

I know its a huge topic, but I want to know more about these phenomenons. I did a bit of reseach into fake news, echo chambers and proliferation of information, but I am also interested in the development of society as whole. The youth growing up today have fundamentally different possibilites and face fundamentally different challenges. Are there any projections what that will mean for society, media and politics?

**TL/DR:** I want to know about the soliological consequences of the internet and, if there are any, projected changes to our social structures, especially media and politics.

The safety and comfort of visitors is part of their regular management review, and of particular concern to the community is the safety of children who visit or live there.

My wife and I were talking recently about how safe it is for kids there, despite everyone being nude. This got me thinking about whether children who are sexually assaulted are not so much victims of attraction, but rather victims of opportunity. That is to say, I wonder if most men who assault children prefer adult women but have little outlet for their sexual urges, or have a hyper-association with nudity equating sex.  At a nudist resort, where everyone is used to seeing nude bodies, the site of children isn't itself a trigger as it might be for individuals who have other issues going on. 

So, getting back to my original question, do we know whether societies with ""healthier"" attitudes towards sex and the human body have lower rates of child assault?

What I have known is the process of earning less money for doing more work when I was younger, and becoming 'spoiled' as I've gotten older and commanded more money - I expect it now.

Similarly, changes in lifestyle, amount of work, free time, and the ability to live a certain way, all seem to 'normalize' to me. What was once a special thing, like eating at a certain restaurant, becomes a normal thing, and it doesn't necessarily make you any happier. Happiness, instead, is an elusive thing that seems to not respond to relative quality-of-life increases, but instead seems to be more about mindset and expectation. 

I wonder, if I grew up in the third world, to what extent would my happiness be relative, and to what extent would it be absolute, and poorer do to my situation? 

I know this is a large-ish question, but I'm curious to what extent we have answers to it in the field of Psychology.",NA,"9pg8e0",NA,0,NA,FALSE,1542625148,FALSE,"self","t5_2sml9",NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,NA,"/r/AskSocialScience/comments/9pg8e0/to_what_extent_psychologically_do_higher_quality/",NA,NA,FALSE,NA,NA
