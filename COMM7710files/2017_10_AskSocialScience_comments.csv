"I posted a reply to a similar question on r/sociology a while back which seems relevant to your concerns. The question asked why old theories were still used when we have newer theories to work with.

&gt;The best answer I can provide for you is that “theories” are quite nebulous things in sociological research, which are used, refuted, and constructed in quite different ways not only depending on one’s general epistemological stance or methodological approach, but also depending on what one sees to be the major purpose of sociological inquiry. One way to think about this is to look at [this](http://imgur.com/a/PDtBh) diagram from Jeffrey Alexander's work *Theoretical Logic in Sociology*. It attempts to capture the thought that scientific logic does not just revolve around the construction of propositional theories of the purely formal kind – or, to use the language of the chart, in the propagation of laws, complex and simple propositions, and so on – but also involves more abstract levels of thinking which are in principle less amenable to empirical study and thus to empirical falsification. So, in many respects, when individuals use or draw upon classical theories, or circumvent contemporary developments in such theories, they are doing so in a way that targets these more general aspects of the scientific continuum, using them for inspiration and orientation rather than extracting specific propositional laws from the texts. On can think, in this case, of a theoretical paradigm like Marxism, whose general analytic assumptions (about man, about society, about work, etc.) continue to inspire social research despite many of Marx’s concrete definitions, propositions, and laws (e.g. the labour theory of value, or the tendency of the rate of profit to fall) being falsified or amended by present research.

&gt;To give you some more concrete examples, we can think of “theories” as involving, one the one hand, laws and theoretical propositions – i.e. statements which interrelate certain concepts or variables, like f=ma in physics, or Golden’s law in sociology (as industrialisation increases, so does literacy) - and, on the other, general models, concepts, and analytical assumptions, like the assumption, within sociological systems theory, that it is feasible to study social phenomena using concepts derived from systems science. This latter assumption is, however, basically an article of faith, and social research using this theory is not generally addressing the question of whether social systems actually exist, but rather whether interpretations of social phenomena based on the supposition that they do exist have some kind of utility at other levels of the scientific continuum. The major point here is that while specific theories are quite often superseded and replaced by more complex theories on the level of laws and propositions, theoretical paradigms, which contain a range of general metaphysical assumptions, have greater staying power, for the simple reason that they are more removed from the empirical environment. To quote Alexander:

&gt;&gt;”General theoretical elaboration is normally dogmatic and horizontal rather than sceptical and vertical. Theoretical formulation does not proceed, as Popper’s empiricism would have it, according to the law of the “fiercest struggle for survival,” basing generalizations only on positions which have not yet been empirically falsified and subjecting such formulations in a completely open-minded and purely sceptical manner to critical empirical attack. To the contrary, when a general theoretical proposition is confronted with contradictory empirical evidence that cannot be ignored, it proceeds to develop ad hoc hypothesis and residual categories in order to encompass and “explain” these phenomena without surrendering its more general formulations”

&gt;Or, in other words, it is quite rare for the empirical falsification of a proposition to lead to a simple refutation of a “theory” more abstractly understood. Instead, what one most often sees is the either a) the formulation of auxiliary hypotheses which protect the core assumptions of the theory or b) reformulations of theoretical propositions at a higher level of abstraction. This is, I should add, especially true in the social sciences, where theories are more likely to be constructed in a loose, discursive manner, rather than through well operationalized concepts and formally articulated hypothesis. One can thus always debate what the theorist 'really meant.' Because of this, theory in the social sciences often tends towards the “metaphysical” side of the scientific continuum, rather than the empirical side, which not only makes it hard (but by no means impossible) to see the development of sociological theory as a progression of understanding and insight, but also may help to explain why sociology retains a higher degree of interest in classical thinkers than other, more empirically sophisticated sciences. 

While more positivistically minded theorists have made the argument that the endless interpretation of the classics is an issue, and reflects the immaturity of the discipline in comparison to fields such as psychology and economics, others argue that sociology is simply unsuited to the formal mode of theory construction.  Alexander, for example, argues that sociology will always occupy a unique place between the sciences and the humanities, and will never have the status of a cumulative, empiricist science, for the following reasons:

1.  In contrast to the physical sciences, social sciences study objects which are either mental states or conditions in which mental states are embedded. This creates quite different conditions of validity and verification. Alexander notes, for example, that ""the possibility for confusing mental states of the scientific observer with mental states of those observed is endemic.""  One might also here think of Giddens' famous concept of the ""double hermeneutic"" - the idea that sociologists have to interpret objects which interpret themselves. Social scientific knowledge always re-enters into the world which it describes, and this naturally limits its capacity to formulate objective, law like descriptions of social phenomena. This is a significant obstacle for cumulative growth in sociological knowledge.

2. These differences allow for disagreements to emerge as to what constitute the basic empirical referents or elemental units of social science. One may think, for example, of the continued debate about the concept of society. These disagreements are often exacerbated because  social scientific knowledge has a distinctly evaluative component. Its descriptions of the world carry ""significant implications for the desirable organization and reorganisation of social life,"" which naturally leads to quite vociferous arguments within the field.  

3. Because there is a relatively low level of consensus about the basic empirical referents of sociology as a discipline, there is likely to be even less consensus about the abstractions which are drawn from these referents. You may contrast this with a discipline such as physics, or even economics, in which the meaning of basic theoretical terms is relatively stable. For Alexander, this places significant limitations on the degree to which theoretical knowledge in sociology can be expressed in a quantitative form, and as scientific consensus is often dependent upon mathematization this has a fragmenting effect. In his view, efforts to create formal, quantitatively expressed laws in social science are simply ""efforts at disguising or promoting particular points of view,"" and are thus unlikely to gain much support in the discipline.

For Alexander, these various issues mean that *discourse* (""modes of argument which are more consistently generalised and speculative than...normal scientific discussions"") is bound to remain a major feature of the social sciences, and that as such sociological knowledge will always be differentiated into a plurality of competing traditions which draw on their classical heritage. Discourse is, as explained above, not cumulative or progressive in nature. It is not simply assessed as right or wrong but is rather evaluated in light of a range of indistinct criteria, including ""logical coherence, expansiveness of scope, interpretive insight, value relevance, rhetorical force, beauty, and texture of argument."" These are all things which individuals appreciate in classic texts, and it helps to explain their enduring appeal and relevance within the discipline.  

Of course, this is only one position. As I mentioned, various movements within the discipline have sought to upset the hegemony of discursive theories and to encourage, in their place, more formal models of theory construction which take predictive capacity to be the sole arbiter of ""good"" theory. This kind of orientation would, one assumes, encourage the development of cumulative theory which would eventually render classical texts scientifically obsolete. A good example of work in this vein is Gibbs' text *Sociological Theory Construction.* Whether one finds these efforts persuasive depends quite heavily on personal proclivities and tastes. I recommend you read widely on the issue and see what model you believe has the most utility vis-a-vis your own goals as a student or researcher.

"As a point of clarification, are actually Marx, Weber, Durkheim more important to sociology as a research science than Smith, Ricardo, Pareto are to economics, or are they just more emphasized when teaching undergraduates? I suspect the latter and that you wouldn't necessarily see the first set of three cited more in ASR or AJS than the second three would be cited in AER. This seems to be question less about sociology as a science and more about sociology as a pedogagy.

"In general, the Nordic model is more progressive than the German Social Market economy. Both have many similarities such as having policies that promote free market economies while promoting social equality and well-being. Both also have advanced welfare states that include things like some form of public healthcare, public pensions, generous unemployment insurance, etc. Both also feature relatively high levels of labor union membership and cooperation between unions and corporations. I'll post some data about union membership by country, but in Sweden and Iceland, for example, almost 85%-90% of workers are in some type of union while it's around 20% in Germany (I've seen data ranging from 17%-30%.) This shows how much each model welcomes union cooperation with corporations, which goes on to impact wages, education, benefits, etc.

However, the German Social Market is more inspired by Catholic Social Teaching and the Nordic model is more inspired by Lutheranism. Lutheranism promotes more state involvement in society and the economy and a nationwide community of believers, while Catholic Social Teaching (which is a massive topic in itself) generally promotes less social involvement by the state and more cooperation within ones social group. You can see this influence in many ways when looking at these models. For example, the levels of decommodification, which is defined by Gøsta Esping-Andersen as the level of independence citizens have from the market. The more decommodified you are, the more services are viewed as entitlements rather than something that must be individually paid for. According to Esping-Andersen's decommodification index, states that follow the Nordic Model have higher levels of decommodification than the German Social Market economy/other states with similar, Christian-Democratic (according to Esping-Andersen's classifications) models, like Italy and France for example. The levels of decommodification on his index range from about 24-29 in more conservative/Christian-Democratic states, and from about 31-40 in Social-Democratic states (i.e., Nordic Model.) I'll post the index in the sources. 

The difference in levels of decommodification should give you a good idea of how the services between these models differ. Generally, services in Social-Democratic countries are universalist, meaning you benefit from the welfare state because of your citizenship. While services in Christian-Democratic countries, while still relatively generous, differ when it comes to who receives them, like families receiving more than a couple or a single person and are not solely based on citizenship, but rather a combination of citizenship and employment/taxes you pay.

There are minor differences, like the duration of unemployment benefits and how much they cover, between countries, and this is a very large topic that you can spend a whole class on (I did, and I highly recommend taking a class on welfare states and economic models), so I'll post a paper below (Scruggs and Allan) which I think covers the topic very well and includes lots of country-specific data. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Again, this is a very large topic so I tried my best to include what I believe highlights the main differences between the two.

It is extremely influential in economics, political science, and sociology and offers a great excellent look into this topic.

Edit: I assume by your username that you're looking at this from a British perspective. The UK is a little difficult to define as one of Esping-Andersen's welfare states and is more commodified than Germany and Scandinavia, but is obviously much more decommodified than the U.S. (writing this as an American), which Esping-Andersen defines as Liberal.

"&gt;I know that corruption has been a huge concern in Brazil

Yea, weak institutions. Young country, lots of international intervention (the US had to keep the commies out of South America, so we were among the ""victims"" in the latter half of the last century)

&gt;as well as the status of their healthcare system, and it sounds like the welfare state is a really pivotal issue for you guys. I definitely have my concerns as an American, but I'm sure that they don't compare to yours.

I actually think the poor have it better down here, since healthcare is a constitutional right. But public hospitals are underfunded (and there's the issue of corruption), so they're not good enough for the middle class, only for the poor. And even if SUS, the national healthcare system, is already underfunded, it's still constantly under threat of being even more; just recently they've passed a bill determining that there will be no increase in healthcare spending above inflation for the next... 20 years. I mean inflation, not growth. So if the economy is stable and growing (which should happen again soon for an emerging country), healthcare spending as a percentage of gdp is probably going down from the ""current"" (2014) 8.3%, which is already lower than in most developed countries.

Tbh, our constitution screams ""we're gonna have a social-democratic government like those guys have in Europe"", people were very optimistic with the whole ""the dictatorship is officially over now"", it's just harder to apply those ideas given our historical and political contexts. Many voters down here say bolsa-família is a ""commie"" thing, and that plan is basically food stamps made to keep people from starving to death like they used to to around 15-20 years ago.",,,,Aquifex,,,1507690393,t5_2sml9,t3_75g9vd,t1_do77dp8,1,1509718074,0,0,do79ipx,AskSocialScience,,,

"Half the time people who talk about gender, are getting their definitions mixed up and aren't using the same definitions other people are using -- so you need to keep that in mind.  Sometimes, people will mix up their definitions in the exact same sentence!  

The word ""gender"" can either be referring to biological sex OR be referring to stereotypes (which are associated with each bio sex).  I feel like the top level comment mixed up their definitions multiple times...  

Every time someone uses the word ""gender"", ask yourself whether using ""biological sex"" or ""stereotypes"" would be more accurate and you'll see what I mean.  For instance, in your own sentence:

&gt;My own concern isnt in upholding the gender binary, but how to let people retain the gender they like without imposing anything on others.

If gender only means bio sex or stereotypes, then what is a ""gender binary""?  Do you mean that humans are a dimorphic species with two biological sexes (plus intersex which is a medical disorder) or are you referring to stereotypes?  When you say ""gender"", what do you mean?  Using more accurate terms, here are the four very different things you could have been asking:

1. My own concern isnt in upholding the two biological sexes, but how to let people retain the biological sex they like without imposing anything on others.

2.  My own concern isnt in upholding the two biological sexes, but how to let people retain the stereotype they like without imposing anything on others.

3.  My own concern isnt in upholding stereotypes, but how to let people retain the biological sex they like without imposing anything on others.

4.  My own concern isnt in upholding stereotypes, but how to let people retain the stereotype they like without imposing anything on others.

You see?  We are all not having the same conversation, because depending on how we subconsciously choose to define that term in each instance, will change the subject.  We are no longer referring to the same things.   Btw, in the following sentence (which you wrote), you could be asking 16 completely different questions, depending on how you choose to define ""gender"" each time you use that word:

&gt;What if in a gender abolished society someone finds positivity and community -- like myself -- in having a gender and being around people of the same gender who are sexually interested in those of the same gender? 

Try re-writing it with accuracy in mind, and either using bio sex when you mean bio sex, or stereotypes when you mean stereotypes.  Femaleness is not defined as a ""human wearing a dress""!!   Nor is malehood defined as ""human wearing pants""!!  See, once again there is an unconsciously conflation of stereotypes with bio sex.

The library would probably be your best bet, but to initially familiarize yourself with the landscape of a culture Wikipedia is a great starting point to launch off from. You might find a more specific feature you'd like to look into more. You can also look at the sources cited at the bottom of the Wikipedia page to get ideas of what books to check out

"There are always going to be conflicting views on every theory. For example, most first year anth students will read Jared Diamond to introduce them to the basics of anthropology, only to have him torn apart by professors in the third and fourth years. It doesn't mean it's a waste of time to read those books. It's all about gaining a comprehensive perspective. 

You don't need to have access to a university library, public libraries are equally as valuable and free. 

Here are some of the textbooks I have been assigned -

The third chimpanzee, guns germs and steel, collapse all by Jared Diamond. These are good basics for human cultural evolution. 

For the development of anthropology through the ages, I would highly suggest Sociocultural Theory in Anthropology by Garbarino. 

For biological anthropology, Genome by Matt Ridley, The Selfish Gene by Dawkins, and The Moral Animal by Robert Wright. 

For a more philosophical perspective of anthropology, Loren Eisley is great. Particularly The Immense Journey. 


Those are all books I read in first year anth, everything after that is pretty specific to a certain topic or region like pregnancy practices in the US or Mayan archaeology 

I think getting a good understanding of how to mentally approach and unpack an anthropological topic will help you in finding more resources on specific areas. It's also valuable to be able to recognize a valid source vs an unreliable one - that just takes practice and exposure.

"Luckily I happened to pull out my old college marketing textbook, which goes into a concept similar to this in detail. Bear with me, though, as I am on mobile. 

In the 5th edition of ""Marketing: the Core"" by Kerin, Hartley, and Rudelius, there are four distinct eras of production and marketing within the US. 

- The first, called the *production era*, encompasses the time before roughly the 1920's. Goods produced in this era were typically scarce,  including commodities. If a shipment of sugar made it to your harbour, that is the sugar available to buy. 

- Following this was the *sales era*, which lasted into the 1950's. Post-war production resulted in an abundance of products and goods. Facing new competition, firms hired salespeople to market and differentiate their product from the rest. This is where we begin to see the dominance of the door-to-door salesman. Once firms no longer needed to worry about supply constraints, they had more free reign to begin marketing to consumers who would otherwise have no need for the product in question. If you were a globe seller, you sold globes to anyone with a pulse. This is the era of the hard sell.

- The late 50's to early 60's was roughly the time that we entered the *market orientation phase*, which is when firms began incorporating marketing efforts as a key aspect of their operations. This is where we find the emergence of the marketing stereotype-- the ""Mad Men""-esque push to market goods to fit a lifestyle. This is the era of catchy jingles and TV shows designed around selling toys. 

- We are now entering the most interesting (and potentially most frightening) era, the *customer relationship era*. This era is defined by continuous data collection and creating an all-encompassing experience for the consumer. Companies want the consumer to feel like their products are part of the family, and push to establish a more personal relationship between the brand and the consumer. This is the era of Alexa, targeted ad tracking, and product subscriptions. 

Per your question, it is arguable that ""consumer culture"" as we know it emerged the moment that strong enough market competition warranted strategies that ""pushed"" goods on the consumer rather than ""pulling"" on existing demand. Prior to the *sales era*, advertisements for household goods acted mainly to inform the consumer when and where they could purchase goods, and no more.",,,,Raccoonpuncher,,,1507636267,t5_2sml9,t3_75f2xc,t3_75f2xc,13,1509694021,0,0,do5yiz0,AskSocialScience,,,

"This can be a tricky question given the various ways people might define consumer culture, but I think a broad definition has some merits with regard to your question. I'd say the term can be said to encapsulate strong proclivities for the consumption of commercial products, which functions in a number of ways from want-satisfaction, identity construction and status attainment. 

Since the arrival of mass media marketing has been a strong factor in determining wants and shaping identities and the determinants of social status. The consumption of commercial products at the centre of consumer culture reinforces the notion that it is a product of the expanding market economy and market society itself. Prior to mass media and the modern market economy the culture surrounding consumption, and in general, was quite different.

Considering the type of economic organisation that existed prior to market economies as the central institution in economic life should allow for some idea of the culture around consumption that existed before. Polanyi covered a lot of this in [The Great Transformation](http://inctpped.ie.ufrj.br/spiderweb/pdf_4/Great_Transformation.pdf). The industrial revolution precipitated the rapid expansion of markets and greatly increased the accessibility of huge numbers of commercial products. Looking back to the feudal era a very different picture emerges. Not only were goods far more limited but the nature of economic activity was fundamentally different, occurring as either a function of social relations like that between a serf and his lord or within peripheral markets; that is to say, markets that were not vital to the functioning of the social and economic order.

Reciprocity is another noteworthy economic principle that preceded consumer culture. This has nothing to do with the attainment of commercial goods for individualistic goals, instead emphasising the role of social status and collectivistic notions of interdependence.

I hope that was of at least some help.

"Not true. In the ethnographic record, the division of labor is highly variable. The general rule is that men will hunt big game while both men and women may engage in hunting small game, gathering, or fishing depending on the availability of resources at any specific time and place. There are, however, even exceptions to that generality and a few societies where women hunt big game. There's no evidence to suggest that Paleolithic hunter-gatherers were not similarly variable. Ancient matriarchy proponents also try to provide evidence by trawling through the records of ancient art and proclaiming that any female figures must represent some kind of goddess, regardless of context.

"There are many frameworks of theories in which these would mean different things, and I encourage you to use these terms independently and change these definitions until they work to describe society in the most accurate way. 

However. Let me get at this from the social constructionism side. Institutions here are any kind of organization of people persisting  over time. 

Any thing said or spoken or that persists over time that is shared between people is socially constructed, and is therefore a social construction. 

For a consistent picture of this, I recommend reading “The social construction of realty” by Berger and luckmann.

"I can partly answer this from the institutional perspective. Specifically institutional logics.

Institutional theory is generally about how institutions shape our world and behaviour. In modern interpretations and variations, there's more thought to how individuals can change or influence institutions.

I'm most familiar with *institutional logics*. These are sets of institutions that belong and occur together. In the theory behind institutional logics, it is assumed all these institutions persist because people act them out and pass them on. Yet their behaviour is shaped by these same institutions. See Thornton &amp; Ocasio (2008).

In this perspective institutions are indeed social constructs shaped by and simultaneously shaping our behaviour.

Bourdieu's *Homo Academicus* analysed, among a lot of other things, the relationship between the faculty of a staff member (not just any graduate, and not their major, I'm afraid) and their voting preferences in the 1981 election (confusing, given a lot of the other data in the book was based on studies conducted in the early 1960's). If you have access to the book, look for the variables 'voted for Mitterrand', 'voted for Giscard' and 'voted for Chirac', and bear in mind that in the 1981 election Mitterrand was further left than he would become known for.

"&gt;one couldn't make statements about a text based upon personal experience.

But of course, your interpretation of the text is going to be based upon your own experience.  

Honestly, this is an incredibly complex topic and way to much for a Reddit post.  I think a good book that might get you thinking on this topic is *[The Social Construction of Reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Construction_of_Reality)* by Luckman &amp; Berger.  That said, I'll give a brief response.

&gt;I argued that the individual's experience / opinion doesn't have particular value when discussing the texts meaning

You're working under the assumption that meaning can be objectively constructed and accurately apprehended.  In some instances, for example on simple textual constructions, this is a fair assumption.  If, for example, I say, ""go to the store and buy some milk,"" there is no question of what I intend or how I mean it.  But when it comes to more complex works, especially aesthetic and philosophical, then you necessarily have to project your own conceptions of concepts onto the text itself, and thus your own bias is going to function in its interpretation.  The text then reflects back to you what you already think about the concepts contained within the text.

For example, let's say that I argue, ""everyone should be just, because justice is a virtue."" Of course, we all have some conception of justice, but is it the same conception?  Did we come to our conception of justice through the same means?  Perhaps you formed your initial feelings about justice when someone stole something for you.  But perhaps you are a woman, and you formed your first conceptions of justice when someone sexually harassed you. Overtime, you build up your notions of justice through different means, and when you read about justice, the concept itself is interpreted by you in a way that was shaped by your own experiences; this then causes you to assign meaning to the concept of justice within the text.

The same applies to the concept of virtue.  What is a virtue?  No doubt you have at least a vague answer of what this means, but this answer will be shaped by, among other things, the manner in which virtue has been represented to you in your social context.  Women, for example, have historically been considered unvirtuous by some by virtue (no pun intended) of their menstrual cycles.  This lad lead to women being shamed for having them.  Could this lead women to have a different notion of virtue, that they would then impose onto the text they're interpreting?  I think the answer to that is fairly obvious.

So yes, when you interpret a text you are viewing it through your own lens, and that lens may not be the lens through which others are interpreting it, nor what the author intended. ",,,,Mentalpopcorn,,,1508362132,t5_2sml9,t3_7727fr,t3_7727fr,4,1509959346,0,0,dok4rxt,AskSocialScience,,,

"I'm a quantitative sociologist and in general I can be pretty impatient with theoretical or philosophical discussions--mostly because they use words like ""positivistic"" that ensure that only people who already understand the discussion can take part in the discussion. BUT, even I have to admit that theoretical sociology has a place in sociology. 

Traditional science, including social science, is different from, say, data mining because we begin with hypotheses which we then test with data. But how do we form the hypotheses? There are two main ways:

* Theory! This is where the guys doing ""abstract philosophy or creative writing"" get to shine. They think up really smart shit and we get to test it to see if they're right. 

* Qualitative research. The folks doing interviews, ethnographic research, focus groups, observations, etc are also doing important work, even if they only have a sample size of 8. They notice phenomenons and form hypotheses, which we as quantitative researchers get to test. Plus qualitative research is a joy to read. 

One last thing: Later in the thread you mention that you don't like the Marx focus. Let that challenge you to read the text extra closely. Try to come up with counter-arguments or spot places where the theory is outdated. Just because you don't like Marx (and I totally get it) doesn't mean you can't learn from studying him.

"What is your goal? I guess the main question is: Are you trying to learn specific topics as a foothold to a possible career in the areas you listed, or are you just interested in passively learning about these topics for your own enjoyment? Depending on your end goal, some channels are more suitable than others. 

I know of 1 channel that covers **all** of those topics in a sort of ""classroom"" format: [Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/user/crashcourse) Check out their playlists for full lessons in specific topics. It's pretty well-made, they have teams of experts in each respective field consulting on the videos, and they do a good job of keeping things interesting but still educational.

Some more specialized channels related to the topics you mentioned, in no particular order:


* [Braincraft](https://www.youtube.com/user/braincraftvideo) covers psychology, sociology, and culture related topics in sort of a mini-documentary format.
* [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/user/1veritasium) does lots of pop-science videos, which often intersect with psychology or sociology. 
* [ASAPScience](https://www.youtube.com/user/AsapSCIENCE) also makes general pop-science videos which often involve psychology, sociology, or culture.
* [CGP Grey](https://www.youtube.com/user/CGPGrey) sometimes does geopolitics, the most popular of which are probably his explanations of [the electoral college in the US](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wC42HgLA4k), [how the United Kingdom works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNu8XDBSn10), and his historical misconception videos, among other things. 
* [Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/user/Kurzgesagt) does medium-length science-explainer videos that often involve geopolitics and culture.
* [Sci-Show](https://www.youtube.com/user/scishow) and [SciShow Psych](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUdettijNYvLAm4AixZv4RA) does a wide variety of videos about science that overlap with the areas you mentioned in different ways. They post multiple videos per-week and they answer a lot of random questions people have about everyday science and psychology related things.
* [VSauce](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6nSFpj9HTCZ5t-N3Rm3-HA), [VSauce2](https://www.youtube.com/user/Vsauce2), &amp; [Vsauce3](https://www.youtube.com/user/Vsauce3) covers anything curiosity-related and has lots of videos involving psychology.
* [SmarterEveryDay](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6107grRI4m0o2-emgoDnAA) is another pop-science channel that sometimes makes psychology videos.

Then there are also a whole bunch of culture vloggers that do video essays on pop-culture from an academic perspective but may or may not be what you're interested in depending on exactly what you are looking for such as [Pop Culture Detective](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHiwtz2tCEfS17N9A-WoSSw), [Feminist Frequency](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7Edgk9RxP7Fm7vjQ1d-cDA), and [Nerdwriter](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJkMlOu7faDgqh4PfzbpLdg) just to name a few that immediately came to mind.

"I think the difference in technology NOW vs say 1966 (Yeah like Star Trek) is that not only is it displacing earlier social activities (Lodges for example or rec sports), but that it changes the expectations people have for social interactions.  Modern media makes it extremely *easy* to shut out ""imperfect"" things.  In social interaction, this means that you expect that there should be a high degree of agreement between people on a whole spectrum of ideas, norms, values, media tastes, etc.  so where in 1955, even up to 1990 a democrat and a republican could easily come together to do something, it's harder today because we sort of expect that no one will disagree on major issues, and if the difference is too big, you can easily cut that person out.  Even dating sites have this option.  There are conservative dating sites (and more than likely liberal ones as well) where you already know that the person agrees with you -- before you even meet them, heck, before you swipe at their picture, you know they agree with you.  So you don't learn to negotiate difference, you learn to cut out differences.  People easily ""unfriend"" on Facebook over a disagreement, it's never been easier to filter your life for people that disagree, including your family.  

And in the media, it's even easier. You can stream only ideas you like, you can only listen to music you like, or read news you like.  Modern technology kills capital in that way because it's a tool to create bubbles and demographics and so on that put you into groups based on opinions.  But it's so self reinforcing that you might never socially meet anyone outside that group.  I'm nerdy, so I can arrange my life to only interact with other nerds.  I wouldn't have to deal with that jock, or the freak, or the criminal or the princess -- and they do the same.  So your neighbors are strangers.

"Those are all very different questions .

Short answers are: for one of the foundations of social reproduction through education, start with Bourdieu's theory of capital and habitus (lareau is also a good central, more current voice in this realm). This is not just about schools but, what you called, the education system, if conceived very broadly.   

But then you jump down to schools.  That current curricula are flawed and insufficient for providing an equitable education for all is a common theme as well. Check out 'culturally relevant pedagogy.' 

These two generally come from very different worlds, though there is some overlap. The first would be mostly in the Sociology of Education (and Anthropology of Ed). The Sociology of Education Critical reader by Sadovnik will address the first one more. These have been central issues in ed research since DuBois. Michael Apple is also an accessible authors who writes about this, among tons of others. 

The second will take you into a Curriculum and Instruction field. But you have an issue when you ask: do you think this is a good solution to the current flaws in curricula? Because you are assuming that everyone agree on what the flaws are (or that there are flaws in the first place) or how they should best be fixed. It seems here you would want to do something approaching a lit review of how different scholars have conceptualized what constitutes ""flaws in curricula related to racial and ethnic groups not receiving a culturally relevant pedagogy""

And that third category will be mostly found in (Critical) Anthropology of Ed or Educational Psych and Social Psych. For example (not necessarily the best but just one of my interests) social psychs have written lots about the ways certain experiences or perceptions affect racial/ethnic groups differently. This can be found in the Identity Threat/Stereotype Threat literature in social psych. Walton, Cohen, Oyserman, Claude Steele have very interesting stuff in this dept.  

But there would be big differences between that stuff and then anthropology of ed or decolonization studies, which would both be much more interested in knowledge regimes and how certain (i.e. white, enlightenment) epistemologies devalue other knowledges in teh school system. For decolonization, I'd check out Sandy Grande's Red Pedagogy. 

And finally, I'm not really sure what you (or anyone) really means by microagression. For just the current context, are you talking about experiences of racism? (and if so, how do you operationalize that?) the way racism is written into textbooks? the way that (single model of) schools spread through colonization? etc. 

But really, these are such broad questions, tough to know where to send you

First off, really appreciate your help.
I’m focusing on how Native Americans experience racism in school due to misrepresentations of their history or plain ignorance (this is seen through racial microaggressions like thinking they live in a teepee etc) despite schools portraying themselves as an open and inclusive environment- how does this affect their education? What can be done to solve this? and the proposal to implement Afrocentric schools (which those for it, argue, provides a better curriculum for black students to excel in and counters their disengagement from the mainstream, Eurocentric curriculum) - my question is,  what do both these issues say about race/racism in education? What I got is that the system is an institution, and not distinguished from the larger society therefore it will reproduce the power relations that already exist. But I’m not sure if this is a well though out/detailed argument. 

My work is more comparative. I am to compare/contrast the experiences of native Americans vs black youth in the education system in order to demonstrate how education/schooling perpetuates racism. 

Quick question, is critical race theory a good place to start for a solution? I’ve looked at some work on it and it seems comprehensive. ",,,,Getreckless,,,1509209539,t5_2sml9,t3_797mla,t1_dp0gjfd,1,1510269661,0,0,dp0j3pq,AskSocialScience,,,

My recommendation would be to look at a specific set of policies and their enactment across the globe, e.g. how has support for abortion developed over the past few decades. Repositories like the WHO, World Economic Forum, or World Bank might have data on things like this, but be warned- usually the data aren't that clean, and often incomplete.

"Critical race theory differs from these other approaches in that it centers its work on the history of race in specific contexts (for example, what it is to be Black or White in the USA), and therefore attempts to define the constructs that form Blackness, Whiteness, race (things like the legal system, education, policing, popular media). Defining these constructs helps deconstruct race, of the particular beliefs that lead one to have a racist view of the world (arguably inevitable in American society).

Multiculturalism advocates more generally for acceptance of cultural differences, and anti-racism advocates for the abolition of racism. Critical race theory also advocates for these things, but I think does a much better job of emphasizing systematic origins of race. Anti-racism is an opposition to racism, but CRT defines race (particularly within the state), offering a much more specific means of its dismantlement I think. That said, anti-racism is a broad term and some forms could be included under the CRT umbrella.

So for a black student, they can learn to see the ways they've been discouraged by society as systemic problems with historical precedent rather than individual condemnations. Furthermore, enabling students to feel not only that their education is personally relevant but liberating will make students feel much more positively about their education.

Here's a relevant recent example: the Mexican-American studies program implemented in high schools in Tucson, which was banned by the superintendent and then re-instated by a judge (though there's a current standoff), had significant positive effects on test scores and graduation rates for Mexican-American students. From the text of [one study](https://posting.tucsonweekly.com/images/blogimages/2012/11/12/1352763151-112886925-emprical-analysis-mas-report-2012.pdf):

&gt; Of the 12 regression models 
predicting AIMS [Arizona state standardized tests] passing, MAS [Mexican-American Studies] participation was positively related to the dependent variable in 
every case and 
seven
of these relationships were significant.  A similar trend existed for 
graduation rates.  MAS participation was positively related 
to graduating in all eight regression 
models, and this relationship was significant in 
six
of them. 

I couldn't easily find any studies about black education in high schools, but I'm confident the result would be similar.

"So would you say the current education system perpetuates racism and racial inequality because it doesn't operate under a CRT approach? For example, a lot of minority youth experience racism on campus that results in a lower self-esteem/self-worth and thus, disengage from academics. how could CRT address this? 

Personally, i find the education system maintains whiteness as the norm by not challenging it. The curriculum is Eurocentric and therefore, black youth or Indigenous youth feel as though their accomplishments are diminished/ignored. 

What I struggle with is understanding the proposal to implement afrocentric schools. It's seen as an alternative solution to the flaws in the mainstream curriculum but would this not simply be another form of segregation? Yes, it would temporarily allow black youth to learn about their historical contributions and empower them to succeed, but without addressing structural/institutional racism - once they leave the school, they will continue to experience exclusion/discrimination? How would CRT address afrocentric schools then?

"I'm glad you found my response helpful. I agree very much with your statement that ""the education system maintains whiteness as the norm by not challenging it"". If there is a dominant, self-perpetuating structure that operates pervasively, then the absence of a challenge is in effect a reinforcement. 

I think the proposal to implement afrocentric schools is an interesting one. Historically Black Colleges like Morehouse are alive and well, and while they don't operate as strictly segregated schools they certainly could be considered afrocentric. As far as I know, black students there find the experience of being surrounded by a majority of black students to be at least preferable/enjoyable, if not something more profound. 

Before the integration of schools, all black schools were in a similar sense afrocentric. Malcolm Gladwell has an [interesting episode of his podcast Revisionist History about this topic](http://revisionisthistory.com/episodes/13-miss-buchanans-period-of-adjustment) - black schools before integration were actually, at least by some accounts, quite nice places for black students to learn, underfunding/poor conditions aside. Black teachers cared for black students and pushed them. If you're not familiar with Franz Fanon, a post-colonial theorist, I recommend his famous work *Black Skin, White Masks*. In it, he suggests that the colonized (his particular group of interest, though it more broadly applies) need to turn away, and find their own truths, to decolonize their minds, before returning for the bigger battle to decolonize society.

As far as your concerns about the mainstream curriculum: I don't know much about these proposals to implement afrocentric schools. Do they propose to teach the same curriculum that is taught in predominately white/Eurocentric schools? If so, then I would agree that this would pose a problem. 

I think that the knowledge garnered from an education based on CRT could be lasting, however, as it is in its most effective form (in my opinion) not just theoretical but highly practical - black students may go to black schools, but they will still experience racism in everyday experience. This racism can be understood by that very same education in CRT - and this provides a lens to view the world that aims critical feelings outwards, towards structures of racism, and not inwards. CRT would not on its own end racism, of course, and feeling excluded or discriminated against is bound to be distressing. I don't entirely understand what your specific concern is, so my response might be off the mark somewhat.",,,,casualgardener,,,1509226727,t5_2sml9,t3_79b864,t1_dp0ug4b,5,1510277392,0,0,dp0w8c6,AskSocialScience,,,

"I will definitely check out Fanon's work! That's an interesting take to afrocentric schools, one I had not considered - but now that I think about, is quite true. Racism and feelings of inferiority are often internalized (as seen with disengagement from school) and I guess afrocentric schools would provide black youth an opportunity to redefine themselves. 

Afrocentric schools would have a curriculum that focused on black-lived realities (racial profiling etc. to demonstrate that racism continues to exist despite overt policies being dismantled) and teach the contributions of blacks to the formation of society instead of a Eurocentric curriculum, that tends to focus on Christopher Columbus etc. However, a recent report has shown that black youth find implementing afrocentric schools as problematic because they believe it will result in further stigmatization (Fear of stigmatization by Megan Gordon). Instead, they believe this should be incorporated into the mainstream curriculum- would that be the same as CRT?

It's seems like a tricky policy because, it has the potential to be viewed as 'special treatment' in comparison to other minority groups who feel as though the Eurocentric approach is not servicing them as well. 

I guess my concern is how CRT would be operationalized in schools if racism is no longer overt as many university campuses have a racial climate. My main question, something that is so simple but hard to put into words, is how education and/or schools perpetuate race and racism. How does the edu system benefit from maintaining whiteness?",,,,Getreckless,,,1509228352,t5_2sml9,t3_79b864,t1_dp0w8c6,2,1510278049,1,0,dp0xggs,AskSocialScience,,,
"One thing to remember is that CRT is a general umbrella term for a framework that critically examines the formation of race. That's interesting about fear of stigmatization - seems like a good point. Incorporating pro-black elements into the main stream curriculum sounds like a good thing, absolutely - it's not clear to me that that would be CRT though, in fact it sounds more like a multicultural approach. A CRT curriculum would once again need to at some point center the systematic methods used to racialize black people, and the history of that racialization. 

I think that it's true that a black-centered approach would have the potential to feel like special treatment, but I think relating the systems that racialize black people to the systems that, for example erase indigenous people, provides a powerful framework for common ground among minorities. There is a lot of black feminist writing that espouses this ""united amongst our different oppressions, through acknowledgement of each of them"" approach. Excuse me while I wax historical for a moment:

The foundation of the American state, and American capitalism, which is arguably the driving force of America, is on one hand settler colonialism, which operated through the literal genocide of indigenous people in order to seize land (material wealth), and on the other hand slavery, which dehumanized kidnapped Africans into a source of labor to work the land Americans had seized. The two forces go hand in hand. 

Another example: Irish-Americans have a poor history in the United States, and were initially racialized and mocked when they immigrated. How did they escape it? Irish-Americans competed directly with black people for low-wage labor. [Irish-Americans resorted to anti-black racism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/305686.How_the_Irish_Became_White) in order to successfully integrate into American society and gain priority for those jobs. Asian-Americans are also exploited for cheap labor, historically subject to harsh immigration laws, and then used as justification for anti-blackness (the model minority myth). 

The education system is ultimately a source of governance. It tells students, impressionable children, what to think. It teaches what history is and students, particularly white students, assume generally that what has been taught is true and sufficient. And it is determined by local, state, and federal governments, and implemented by teachers. If there is an alignment between these with the perspectives and values of whiteness, then of course the education system will maintain whiteness. White people benefit from the erasure of the histories of minorities, it means they can continue to receive disproportionate benefits from the state at the expense of those minorities. Minorities histories, and their marginalization, is also their claim to better treatment. So if you erase their claims - ""racism isn't that bad/doesn't exist anymore"", ""it's [black people]/[women]'s own fault that X/Y/Z"" then you don't have to fix anything. And so white men have that much more power (as it is entrenched systemically, socially, historically with respect to wealth, etc) over everyone else. 

A bit of a rant, but hopefully there's things in there that feel worthwhile.",,,,casualgardener,,,1509231667,t5_2sml9,t3_79b864,t1_dp0xggs,3,1510279365,0,0,dp0zxtj,AskSocialScience,,,
" interesting topic for sure. I am not an expert on this but have done some research here during my doctoral coursework. 

is this for an BA thesis? MA-level paper?

I have plenty of sources to suggest, but I htink that will only be of limited help later on. They would include Sandy Grande (Red pedagogy), Taiaike Alfred (lots, like Warrior Scholarship), Glen Sean Coulthard (Red Skin White Masks) and Linda Tuhiwai Smith (Decolonizing Methodologies) are some of the main areas to start in thsi world in addition to the more classic stuff by Deloria. But you definitely need to at least think about stuff like Swisher's ""Why Indian people should be the ones to write about Indian education."" Critical Race Theorists are a bit more common and well known. 

But I think the main point for you at the moment would be to narrow down your two comparison groups to a meaningful level that would yield a worthwhile comparison. the black experience and the native american experience are simply way to wide to address coherently in anything less than a book series. 

My suggested option would be a pick a place and compare the black and native american experiences with schooling there. This decision could be guided by: where you are located, the importance of that place, or even, more simply, what situations have enough literature to support such a study. You could also do this by purposefully picking two relevatory sites, even if they were not in the same place, but linked in some other important way (early boarding schools of black and NA populations). But this is very important. What exactly will you be juxtaposing. 

This would also help you mostly deal with an important issue on both sides, but especially the indigenous one: the diversity of native american experiences with the state/schooling is huge across the country/world. Lumping the indigenous experience into one is inaccurate and very problematic (and offensive). you probably know all that, but it's tough and important to make that explicit in the design of a research project. 

And while I would agree that there is no question that US (and many other countries') schools have institutionalized racism, this is not the only way that many NA would talk about their experience because race (based on skin color) is not the only thing at work. Many NA look as white as anyone else. So you would need to strong framework for understanding discrimination. Is it racism based on overt exclusion? forced inclusion? or the devaluation of epistemologies or what? 

So, my final two cents: pick a very specific place in real history and compare the experience of black and the native american (specific to the tribes(s) indigenous to that place) in state supported schooling during a specific (and short) period in history.

"I will definitely look into the sources you have provided. The work I am doing is for my thesis in sociology of education to demonstrate how education and schooling continues to legitimize and normalize whiteness and in the process, perpetuates racism. I'm looking at this in terms of the treatment of NA and Blacks in schools both through racist encounters with other students/faculty as well as, a White-favoured curriculum. 

An overview would be: 
To discuss the history of colonization asit lead to white supremacy and constructed NA as 'savages' in need of 'saving' - this justified the implementation of residential schools in Canada which furthered this process of assimilation towards European values. I am arguing, current edu curriculums do little to nothing to challenge this rather, reproducing a Eurocentric curriculum contributes to the ongoing isolation, marginalization and exclusion of Indigenous persons. I will use particular studies to explore this as well as, many Indigenous students (subjective because they may not all experience it) refrain from attending post-secondary institutions because of the lack of understanding towards their culture/history. 

Then, I look at the history of slavery which produced similar constructions for Blacks. In doing so, I will argue that the failure in the current edu system is why afrocentric schools are being proposed. They are not a new form of segregation, but a necessary alternative because mainstream schools reinforce this idea of 'whiteness' - as well as, representation in schools (ex. authority figures) for blacks is something that is also ignored. 

So, instead of academic performance being individualized or poor grades being internalized as 'laziness' - we must look at the edu system as an institution that reproduces a social hierarchy where whiteness dominates. 

I hope this makes it clearer.

"1 &amp; 2.  I am generalizing about Asia, but would specifically include China, Japan, Vietnam, and perhaps the Koreas.  China, as we know, has had extraordinary high death rates from flooding of its 2 major rivers for centuries.  Both Japan and China have suffered extensive deaths from earthquakes.  (This history, well known, has shaped both nations.)  On Vietnam and Korea I would just cite war deaths.

&gt;Where did that idea come from, and in what context?

It was Westmorland's comment, and it was oft repeated by other commentators re Vietnam and Korean wars.  In the latter, the observations  came up following China's ""human wave"" attacks across the N. Korea border circa 1950.  Our military has long focused on *leaving no man behind* and *minimizing casualties.* That our enemies in Asia did not follow our practice gave rise to this view.  *(One course one can concede these are military men, and not trained academics, making the observations.)*

(Certainly other things could be going on.  The Russians in WWII were also extraordinarily wasteful with their soldiers lives; one could argue that in both China and Russia, totalitarian at the time, ruthless leaders simply decided to be reckless with troops' lives (and that this did not reflect the cultures' outlook on life and death.)

Allied to this is my latter comment  (sorry I do not have links here) about recurring natural disasters in Asia related to aforesaid perspective.  Commentators have made the observation.  I concede it is speculation.

&gt;you have ultimately not provided any supporting arguments as to why your post title may be true, aside from the Westmoreland quote.

A lot of military men supported his view, but my Q could have been better worded.  

So is there any truth here?  I am not wedding to these ideas!  If I am wrong, I am wrong.  But IMO it is a topic with sufficient support that it ought not be simply dismissed as ideas with no or poor substantiation.

Key point:  We are speaking of  *collective grieving over death*, not *individual grieving (i.e., family members).*   (Ancestor reverence was(is) extremely important in Asia [as are funeral rites], and was one of the reasons the Vietnamese rejected U.S. military orders to move into *strategic hamlets.*)  Of course there is linkage between the two, but IMO they somewhat stand apart.  That is why title says ""publicly sentimental.""

So I see 2 factual items:   1) The aforesaid differences in treatment and concern for military personnel, and 2) The role of the U.S. media in expressing these concerns.  When I read Asian media (translated) I do not see the same level of emotionalism about death that is so common in the U.S., i.e., ""collective grieving.""  

And 2 other factors speak to Asian perspective on the value of human life:  1)  A host of notable practices in China (some discontinued today, some not):  widespread death penalty (1,634 in 2015, according to Amnesty International), forced abortions, forced labor for prisoners,  tolerance of forced organ harvesting.  2) Japan's extreme violence in WWII (yet unacknowledged, compared to Germany), including widespread torture and murder of prisoners.  Again, areas relating to the *collective outlook on death.*

Considering all, it seems there are notable differences between East and West here...

"&gt; the stereotype of Asians being emotionless drones to be highly insulting

I did not intend to insinuate this; the ""emotionless drones"" comment is rather exaggerated. The Asian outlook on death can be called pragmatic.  Personally I believe it makes sense.

And it further seems the U.S. is widely regarded worldwide to be overemotional about death, disaster, and collective grief.  I recall years after 9/11 some other world leaders commenting that we ought to ""get over it.""  Perhaps it is largely the U.S. media that fosters all this...

Mythology doesn't necessarily have to mean a literal belief, but can stand as a way a culture functions and views the world.

For example, many Christians now see the Bible as a more literary text, appreciating it's differences in genre and its use in figurative language.

"I think this is an interesting question that can be tackled from a few angles.

First off, the idea of liberalism as a concept is very dependent on the place you live. For example, in my home country of Canada there are parties that call themselves the Liberals, both federally and provincially, but they come to mean different things to different people. 

Generally when people say *liberalism* in Canada they mean on the centre of the political spectrum, as our federal politics are dominated by three parties: the NDP, the Liberals, and the Conservatives. Whose positioning on the political spectrum in the popular discourse are: left-centre-right respectively. 

Kenneth Carty in his 2015 book characterized the federal Liberals as a ""big tent"" party, adopting policies from the left and right as they saw fit. They've taken a variety of positions and pursued different policies over their one hundred year history including cutting social spending to legalizing same sex marriage. In the most recent federal election, the party, lead by the charismatic Justin Trudeau, positioned themselves on the centre-left of the spectrum. The specific campaign politics of which you can read about [in this Maclean's article](http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/federal-election-2015-when-left-is-right-and-the-middle-is-left/)

The regional liberal parties, many of which aren't directly affiliated with the federal one, offer a different perspective. Many would characterize the British Columbian provincial liberal party as a cente-right party, some even outright calling [them conservatives in disguise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac-AisLaEPs). Mostly because throughout their time in power from the early 2000's under Premier Campbell, they took a strong position of fiscal austerity: deregulating of certain industries, reducing welfare, privatization of government assets. 

The reasons for this disconnect between provincial and federal parties is interesting. There are some theories that because of the dominance of the British Columbian left wing, characterized by the NDP and the Greens, it has pushed the provincial liberals farther to the right. Whether that's true or not, I just wanted to demonstrate that there are varying interpretations of the idea of *liberalism*.

To take this a step further, American liberalism is often characterized by the Democratic Party. However, diverging historical, social, and political situations have made the Canadian federal Liberals to be more leftward than the American Democrats. In Europe, the political landscape again changes which [this /r/AskEurope post goes into a bit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEurope/comments/6bf37o/what_do_the_terms_liberal_and_conservative_mean/). Again, different societies characterize the idea of liberalism in different ways. 

This doesn't even touch on the divergence between modern liberalism and classical liberalism, whose direct traditions began with Locke and then later developed by Smith and Hayek among others. Many economists and political theorists would say the modern Republican party embodies the traits of classical liberalism the most. 

And to actually address your point, what I'm trying to say is that the idea of liberalism is very context dependent. I would argue that despite all the differing opinions between all these liberal parties, most of these groups believe they are, without a better way to term it, *real or true liberals*. 

So where does that bring us with current liberals, whatever that means to you? As /u/karlthebaer said, maybe people become more conservative as they age. But maybe just the idea of liberalism shifts. As we've seen, what constitutes liberalism is hugely context dependent on time and place. Although modern liberalism has a few core tenants, characterizing it on a universal left-right spectrum is rather difficult because what is left and what is right depends on where you are. 

In the future, the political spectrum will undoubtedly shift, whether farther left or right, or for better or for worse. It is really this shift that will determine what becomes of today's liberals. Will they become the conservatives of the future? Maybe, but it really depends on what happens to the political landscape that will change this outcome.

I hope that at least somewhat answers your question!

"&gt; Before going into it, because I can only really speak generally, are you aware of the studies done that show (anecdotally and empirically) that prisoners with something to work toward generally report (significantly) higher levels of satisfaction, belief in their worth as an individual and demonstrate improved behaviour when they're given jobs and a sense of ownership over a project within the prison?

Many of the sample/toy data sets that people work with are from historical data. You could look into the Florentine network, which has information on wealth, marriages, and the low among prominent Florentine families to see how that was gathered and converted.

You might find The Duality of Persons and Groups useful to read. If you can get affiliation or membership data, you can produce bipartite networks, which can then be projected into unipartite networks. I have personally found this very useful for getting networks out of data that wasn't directly gathered to produce networks.

A simple example would be treaties and their signatories. You could produce a network of inter-actor agreements, big and small, based on who has signed which treaties.",,,,AhsasMaharg,,,1506922029,t5_2sml9,t3_73ouv8,t1_dns5yab,2,1509227027,0,0,dnsffun,AskSocialScience,,,

"I don't think it's sexist. I think it's just you observing the consequences of socialization. Women are encouraged to be independent a lot less, and to have friends/sleepovers/etc a lot more even from an early age. Plus they're often raised with the idea that they're frail and need to move in packs for survival purposes like they're zebras or something.

When a man and a woman break up, the woman is more likely to have a functional support network, while the man is more likely to hole up alone and feel shitty with nobody helping him. Women have higher rates of chronic depression, but men are more likely to have individual bouts of depression that could be easily prevented with a good support network. 

Also, men are not encouraged to be vulnerable with others, which often helps in bonding, while women are.

"There is no easy answer to this question. The concept of human rights is not easy to understand in terms of priority. 

There is a lot literature on human rights that take different stances that reflect different times. So what do you mean by human rights? There are multiple and contrasting theories about what they are, what they do, what era of historical formation is most salient, etc. (Costas Douzinas has a post on criticallegalthinking.com about 7 thesis of human rights).

It might seem more ""intuitive"" to you that civil and political rights are preconditions, but it may be that you are preconditioned in a way that makes those right seem like intuitive preconditions.

When the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution to adopt a legal Covenant for human rights (1952) there was a split among member states about what would be included. Western liberal democracies, like the US and Britain, thought only civil and political rights were legally justiciable. The Soviet Union and other communist states thought economic, social and cultural rights were crucial. As a result of this divide and the inability to agree, the General Assembly requested the creation of two Covenants, one for civil and political and one for economic, social and cultural rights. We now have those two Covenants.

Over time, the narrative has developed, as the international regime became more liberal and focused on democracy, to view civil and political rights as first generation and the others as second generation rights. But that is debatable and historically contingent. 

If there is a ""foundational"" right, then it is probably self-determination (common article 1 in the Covenants). There is a huge amount of literature on it (Crawford, Cassese, Berman, Knop etc.).",,,,Nerdsofafeather,,,1506942988,t5_2sml9,t3_72zcqe,t3_72zcqe,1,1509231184,0,0,dnsnbav,AskSocialScience,,,

"Oh boy! This is what I wrote about for my final Master's degree paper :-)

Communalism is an idea formulated by Murray Bookchin. You can read about it in a few of his publications, such as *Social Ecology and Communalism* and *The Next Revolution*. PDFs of both are available with some minor googling. 

Basically, the idea behind communalism is an attempt to bridge the divide between anarchism and communism by creating a politics and social structure that is directly applicable here and now, in the 21st century. By bringing back democracy through the use of popular assemblies (literally your neighborhood gathering somewhere, in person, to hold regular meetings and make group decisions), Bookchin felt that we could create the basis for a dual power economy. This means creating alternative structures that supplant the need for the state, or corporations. 

These assemblies would govern themselves, and they would federate with other assemblies to form a bottom-up ""government."" Bookchin strongly distinguishes between government and statecraft. While governing is simply a natural result of society, in that we need to make decisions that affect different people differently, statecraft is the effort toward creating a *hierarchical* body that has power *over* the people. This must be avoided. 

So this series of federations would look like an inverted pyramid. On top is the neighborhood assembly. On bottom would be some sort of global federative body whose sole job is to coordinate activities relevant to the world as a whole. Because societies would be more local and independent, these activities would be much, much fewer and further between than in today's society. And this global body has no authority over neighborhood assemblies; rather it is the assemblies that delegate power to the larger bodies. Property and capital would be held locally in the hands of these assemblies. 

What we must watch out for, as Bookchin noted, is parochialism. If communities turn *too* far inward then we risk dividing ourselves too deeply. But in this internet age I personally don't see that happening :)

Please let me know if you have more questions!! I'm on mobile so this answer was a bit limited. I don't know *too* much about Rojava but I could probably entertain some basic questions about its structure.

I'd couple that with [Wasserman and Faust's](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/sociology/sociology-general-interest/social-network-analysis-methods-and-applications?format=PB&amp;isbn=9780521387071) classic text- still an insightful look at the deeper mechanics of analysis despite its age.

For something a bit different, there's also [this Stanford project](http://republicofletters.stanford.edu/) on early modern scholarship networks and the dissemination of knowledge.

Analyzing historical networks requires a particularly strong justification for your methodological choices (as should all research...) as it is predominantly qualitative and archival by nature. Be mindful that some of its hurdles in data availability, accessibility, and completeness because of this predisposition cannot always be overcome; however, [getting creative](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/social-science-history/article/blocking-the-future-new-solutions-for-old-problems-in-historical-social-science/DF8F4E38159EC392699E5A568296B542) with resources and knowing how to properly augment your network with both quantitative and qualitative data is hard work that is well-rewarded. Establishing network ties and finding sociological patterns in connections can be arduous but, as I've found, extremely fun!

If you really want to get into SNA and social science research in general, I highly suggest linking up with a data librarian/social science research specialist at a research-intensive university and ask to chat in person/email/Skype about your interest in SNA within historical sociology. More often than not, they'll be thrilled to talk to someone showing interest and that someone even thought to venture into their dark little corner of the library! I'm also more than happy for PMs with questions on anything relating to analysis.

"From my reading, what they did is use logistic regression to estimate the average probability that someone in a given income quantile supports vs. opposes a proposed policy change. (They do not detail what variables, other than income quantiles, are used in their regression estimations, but it seems that only income is used.) 

My initial hunch is that they do this, rather simply averaging responses for each income category, in order to get simultaneous estimates for each income category across all cases in which a national public opinion survey was available that assessed proposed policy changes with a binary response option (support/oppose), and this method allowed them to adjust for the fact that different surveys used slightly different income categories. Essentially, what this is is a fancy way of taking all the available information and estimating average policy preferences across the different income quantiles. They use this info for the median income and high income categories as their IVs in their models. 

You're right, they do not provide much information on how they estimate the logit models for preferences, and it would have been nice if they provided in a footnote or something what the equation for the model looked like. I think they use a quadratic term for income to allow for non-linear relationships between income and preferences. They do write that this allows them to measure - ""imperfectly, but, we believe, satisfactorily""- the preferences for the median income and affluent Americans (p. 568). Also see footnote 33 in the paper, which provides some more information on the fit of the estimates.

It also important to think about how the estimates of preferences might not be ""reliable"", or worse, might not be ""valid."" If they are not reliable, it means they are measured with a lot of random noise, and you would likely see a large standard error for the IV's in the multivariate models and it would bias the results towards null findings. If they are not valid, then it suggests that there is systematic error in the estimates of preferences, such that you are not really estimating preferences at the different income quantiles, but something else, or perhaps preferences plus something else. It seems that since what they do is aggregate from individual-level responses up to average responses using the actual response data, the measures should be valid. Based on the results in the multivariate models, the standard errors don't seem to be unusually large, and if there is random error in the estimates for the median citizens, it would likely be similar to the error for economic elites. The difference in the effects of these variables on policy outcomes is shown to be statistically significant, and I think it seems reasonable to interpret those results as real.

Only about 2% recorded it in their last encounter (numbers are similar for men and women). Generally, McBride and Fortenberry note that recent studies have found higher numbers. It’s hard to compare apples to apples because researchers frequently ask about different time frames: lifetime, last year, last three months, last month, last encounter. This makes it hard to compare. 

Lifetime numbers have unambiguously gone up from the low twenties in the Kinsey report through the early 90’s (interestingly, the Kinsey numbers show much higher rates for women reporting anal sex than men. This is generally different from trend from what we see recently, where depending on the question it’s equal or higher men). The big growth seems to have been around the 90’s: there was a repeated study in 93-95 and 99-00. This study asked about anal sex in the last three months (not of a national sample, but I think of a representative sample of some age group) and the numbers went from roughly 9% to 21%, about equal for men and women.  

They raised some doubt about how accurate these numbers are: a 1999 study found that women were more willing to admit abortion than anal sex. Is this change driven by it being less taboo? Maybe. But I doubt that’s all of the change. 

They discuss reasons people do this. It seems like people who engage in anal sex to “preserve” virginity is accounts for a small proportion of anal sex. Roughly 1% of high school age self identified virgins say they’ve engaged in anal sex. They note the influence of pornographers is widely supposed but there’s not really any good evidence they have to refute or confirm this. 

In review of qualities published material on heterosexual anal sex and in-depth interviews, they uncover a variety of themes that come up again and again (this they say is an exhaustive list of the themes that came up): 

 * Intimacy–trust–gifting: ‘‘For me, anal sex is very intimate, much more so than regular sex.’’

 * Novelty–variety: ‘‘Variety is sexy.’’ 

 * Control–domination: ‘‘For most of my friends, it’s sort of a domination thing.’’

 * Taboo–forbidden–erotic: ‘‘. . . and breaking taboos
is sexy.’’

 * Pain–pleasure: ‘‘I think it can feel good for
anyone—except if you’re too uptight about it,meaning, you’re literally tight assed.’’ 

 * Relationship status–context: ‘‘I first did it with my
husband. It was a regular part of our married sex life, and I enjoyed it.’’

(One interesting, but not surprising thing is that desire for anal sex seems to be primarily, though by no means exclusively, male driven: “A study that investigated the associa- tions between the pleasurability of various sexual activities and behavioral experiences with the activities found gender main effects for anal intercourse, with het- erosexual men rating anal intercourse significantly more pleasurable than women (Pinkerton, Cecil, Bogart, &amp; Abramson, 2003). Among women, higher pleasure rat- ings were correlated with increased behavioral frequency for all behaviors, except anal intercourse. An earlier study of gender differences in college students’ attitudes toward sexual behaviors found that men had signifi- cantly more positive attitudes toward anal intercourse than women did (Wilson &amp; Medora, 1990). A study that explored young women’s motivations for engaging in anal intercourse found that 58% of the women in their sample who had engaged in anal intercourse reported doing so at the request of their male partner (Flannery et al., 2003))

While the data seems clear that there’s an increased prevelance, they seemed to be unsure about exactly why there is an increased prevelance. This is an area I’ve read some in, but not exhaustively, but that seems to be the general consensus. People think it is likely related to pornography. Some have other ideas. For example, some think that sex and relationships are increasingly male driven because of changes in the “sexual market”, using rational choice theory, but I think these are mostly unconvincing. As far I know, essentially all sexual practices have increased in prevelance, including more female focused one. I haven’t seen research on exactly the relative rises, but it seems like most sexual practices have risen more or less in concert. As far as I know, there’s not a neat social science answer as why yet. And, given how sparse data is on these questions especially in representative populations before the explosion of internet porn, I’m not sure we will know. Much of this kind of research is funded by the NIH and the NSF and I believe after Laumann et al.’s big study caused some controversy, they held that all publicly funded sex research had to focus much more narrowly on “health” (meaning, for the most part, AIDS and other STIs, mostly in at-risk populations). Indiana University had a nationally representative big sex study a few years ago. Who funded it? The makers of Trojan condoms, which is not the typical route for big social science studies.

"In todays world, that may more so true, as when someone poor goes to Walmart they spend $100, about 50% of that goes directly back into the market (cost of goods, transportation, and labor costs), with the rest of it going to the corporate account(s), and eventually ending up in either Walmarts vaults, a CEO, or similar. That 50% that doesn't goes to people doing the same thing.

Had it been a Mom and Pop shop, 90% of that would have gone back into the market almost immediately, as the Mom and Pop shop doesn't have the sustainability that Walmart does with and and good months, their cost of ownership is higher (for renting, plus paying for their own home, etc. etc.)

Does this mean couples are having more sex, or couples are having more variety in their sex, or both?

It _is_ tempting to conclude that the variety of sex practices in porn is causing a 'monkey see, monkey do' effect - as if porn is the main way that people learn about sex acts (which I guess is probably true).
I'm now thinking a follow-up question about the effect of pornography on sexuality would be interesting, though judging from your comments there just isn't enough research to back up any conclusions.

"There is no set ""purpose"", it's a product like anything else so the consumer defines meaning. What is the purpose of a candy bar? Sustenance? Pleasure? Luring kids to your van? On the other hand, employers sort of consume the product and then students are responsive to market demand, so there's different approaches to defining this. Your teacher covers a lot of the important ground in the sense that some people are motivated by career preparation and some are motivated by education in and of itself, but the big missing piece is signalling. Consider Bryan Caplan's [thought experiment](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2006/02/mixed_signals.html):  

*Which would do more for your career: A Princeton education, but no diploma, or a Princeton diploma, but no education?*

For an hour-long lecture on the subject, see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LIclg2gkbg). But as much as I love Caplan's brain, his economic focus is rather narrow. He makes excellent points regarding the questionable relationship between a lot of university education and careers, as well as the reality that this information exists online for a sufficiently motivated student. So then, perhaps, is formal education about motivation? If so, is motivation to signal a valid means of getting students to learn for the sake of learning rather than solely focus on careers? We descend into philosophy rather quickly, but it's interesting stuff.    

So there's really two questions here. *Within* the current system, does college education still pay off. [Mostly yes](https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/559300), though many smaller decisions and end goals determine by how much. This is the case even account for [selection effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias) - that is, students who go to college obviously do much better than students who don't (in aggregate), but they are also systematically different, so causal inference is a bit challenging and requires clever research design.  

The second question is, does the current system make sense? A lot of the answer depends on the degree to which you believe markets are rational. Does demonstrating that you can comply to arbitrary rules make for a good long-form interview process? Maybe, but are there better ways? Probably...",,,,VincentStaples,,,1508975843,t5_2sml9,t3_78rhkl,t3_78rhkl,6,1510186378,0,0,dow5fv4,AskSocialScience,,,

"There was a study from the CDC not too long ago that highlighted this phenomenon. Some interesting facts.

https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr036.pdf

""Women who said they are ‘‘mostly attracted to the opposite sex’’ (55%) rather than ‘‘only attracted to the opposite sex’’ (30%) were more likely to have had anal sex with an opposite-sex partner.""

""Close to one-third of heterosexual women have ever had anal sex with an opposite-sex partner compared with 48% of homosexual or bisexual women.""

This may imply that a reduction in over all sexual taboos is related to both a rise in bisexual behavior and anal sex. 

In my anecdotal experience the internet may also be a factor. Not only does it allow people to share details about their anal sex, either through frank sex talk or pornographic context, thus promoting the idea to other, but it also facilitates education about the mechanics and safety of anal sex resulting in more experimenters having a pleasant first anal experience. The idea of using plugs to stretch out the anus prior to anal sex is not something that I commonly heard about ten years ago or so, while now it seems to be far common knowledge. However, I do not have statistical data to pack either of those points up.",,,,demonsquidgod,,,1508975990,t5_2sml9,t3_78mj1k,t3_78mj1k,6,1510186439,0,0,dow5k99,AskSocialScience,,,

"&gt; This is social science, there's almost never a demonstrable causal link. There is no way to demonstrate an irrefutable counterfactual because most social mechanisms are not or cannot be randomly assigned.

The latter point of what you say is, of course, true. I would say that there's been a rather big movement, at least in economics, to use simple statistical methods and research design to come up with causal inference as per your first point, as much as we can do so without the use of real counterfactuals. Of course, the most heavily studied topic is the link between education and earnings, where a causal link has been pretty much established, at least if you trust [David Card's reading of the research](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1573446399030114).

I don't know what you specifically refer to as being classical economics, but if by that you mean the mainstream academic economic profession as it exists today, then I'd say that various behavioral insights are well-tolerated and oftentimes integrated into the discipline already. 

As to this:

&gt;Caplan implies that the primary benefit of a Princeton degree is the signal it sends to its employers, not the value of the education.

It's a classic example of a screening model, it's most likely a reference to [Spence's](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~dirkb/teach/pdf/spence/1973%20job%20market%20signalling.pdf) classic screening model. Which is a pretty cynical model, in that education there has no value whatsoever beyond a cost-signalling device. However, that's not the whole picture, but rather just a stylized model built to address the informational asymmetry present in the job market and the limited solutions on offer. Of course, another intricacy of Spence's model is that it contains a multiplicity of equilibria, a quality that most signalling models share. 

&gt;There are enormous positive externalities associated with education. Educated people create less garbage, are associated with far less violence, are members of generally more stable communities. While I don't have direct data on this, I would guess that most people find educated people to be generally more pleasant on an interpersonal basis and would prefer to have social networks more densely packed with educated people.

These are mostly open empirical questions. To that end, we can all have our opinitions, and I'd wager that by way of human capital accumulation and the confounding effect on productivity, your first point is very likely true, but as for the rest, some evidence would be nice.

&gt;Aside from the opportunity cost that public money spent on education is redirected from other possibly beneficial avenues of such as medical research or poverty amelioration (and frankly, any Libertarian making that argument is shedding crocodile tears as far as I'm concerned) there's really no such thing as too much money spent on education. There's just no real downside to it for society. 

Public spending is costly, in social welfare terms due to the fact that that money has both alternative uses and that it has to be taxed from the society at large, which (depending on the form of tax instrument) will likely have behavioral impacts, not to mention strictly decreasing social welfare.

"&gt;Does this mean couples are having more sex, or couples are having more variety in their sex, or both?

More variety in terms of more variations in sex positions, acts, etc.  I can't remember if the number of sexual encounters among married couples has changed, though that's an important question.

&gt;What was the controversy about? Using public money to fund something 'lewd'?

It's been a little bit since I've read all this stuff, but this happened around the same time as the Republican Revolution in Congress and the controversy over the National Endowment for the Arts supporting ""lewd"" art pieces.  I think the best summary is ""They Said It Couldn't Be Done: The National Health and Social Life Survey"" by Peter W. Miller.  (I'm 80% that's the article I'm thinking of.)

Studying sex in the context of AIDS and public health was fine, but studying sex as something that people do was deemed inappropriate.

"The piece I have in mind is Mark Regnerus's *Cheap Sex*, which was recently released as a book but builds on some earlier papers which were mostly poorly received by other sociologists.  The book reviews so far have been in Right Wing popular press, for the most part.  I expect negative academic reviews to come out over the next few years (most sociologists treat Regnerus like a pariah).  His work presumes that the primary point of relationships is men provide the demand for sex and women the supply of sex, as it were. Not how I would begin to model it.   If you relax those assumptions the model sort of falls apart.   Similarly, he identifies the main changes as women's control of birth control rather than women's entry into the labor market and a more robust welfare state (both meaning that they didn't have to rely on men for things like money, i.e. men's part of the supposed exchange).  If you look at sex anyway different from how he does,  A lot of sociological work was previously done on marriage as exchange, this isn't the first work to frame it that way.  Particularly, work on *interracial* marriage as exchange of *status*: lower status white people marry higher status black people.  Other work looked more at beauty-money exchange: more attractive women married richer men.  And there was for many years before this some evidence for it... but they didn't really treat competing hypotheses.

A pretty good critique of this older literature, if I remember correctly, is Rosenfield's ""A Critique of Exchange Theory in Mate Selection"" in the *American Journal of Sociology*.   Moon's ""Culture and the Sociology of Sexuality: It's Only Natural?"" also looks at the paucity of the market metaphors. Most of the studies that look at exchange only posit exchange.  Ones that look at exchange and homophily (matching) find that matching is more important.  The best article of the lot, and a decent place to start, might be McClintock's ""Beauty and Status: The Illusion of Exchange in Partner Selection?"" in *American Sociological Review*.  I felt that that pretty decisively put an end to that line of thinking with strong empirical evidence (barring newer, better evidence).

Another problem with Regnerus-type theories is that they say women have cheapened sex and this makes men behave worse.  However, a lot of the sociological research on marriage has focused on topics like ""unmarriageable men"", that is, rather than there being an oversupply of sex there's an undersupply of eligible bachelors in poor communities (in well educated communities where a lot of Regnerus's data is from, we actually don't see so much the phenomenon of large numbers of unwed parents, etc).  I forget if he addresses things like this, but if he does, I remember not being satisfied with his answer.

So one of the alternatives to an economic-based market theory is a Bourdieusian field theory-approach.  There's actually a good bit of work on this, but it is often not as empirical as I'd like.  John Levi Martin's ""Theories of Sexual Stratification: Toward an Analytics of the Sexual Field and a Theory of Sexual Capital""  in *Sociological Theory* is probably the best of the bunch.

"Whilst u/wyldcraft has made some good points, I think it's important to be mindful of skill-biased technological change.

There's two main ways that technological advances interact with labour markets.

On the one hand, technology can act as a substitute to labour. For example, self-serve kiosks at places such as McDonalds, or supermarkets. Workers who can be replaced by these things typically have a pretty rough time when it comes to their wages / standard of living.

On the other hand, technology can act as a complement to labour. For example, Microsoft Excel and other software has made a lot of accountant's jobs much easier, making them more productive and raising their wages.

In recent times, it seems as though a lot of technological advances that are complimentary tend to help out high-skilled workers, whereas ones that act as substitutes for labour mostly hurt low-skilled workers, which is not very ideal if inequality is a concern of yours.

As far as solutions go, things such as EITC that u/wyldcraft has mentioned can be quite helpful, and I've also seen a lot of people suggest subsidised retraining programs to help workers adversely effected by technological advances transition into different types of employment, however I'm unaware of the efficacy of these programs as I havn't read much about them.

"In the American political science literature the predominant paradigm is the Michigan Model which essentially argues that all candidate and policy preferences (which may not include all of a persons beliefs and preferences but certainly covers a great deal of it) are essentially partisan. 

Campbell, Converse, Miller, and Stokes argue in their book *The American Voter* [(wikisum)](http://wikisum.com/w/Campbell,_Converse,_Miller,_and_Stokes:_The_American_voter) that, in short, we perceive everything through a partisan lens. That partisan ID is, essentially, inherited from ones parents who impress their ID's upon their children and is unlikely to change. As you have probably observed, party platforms change with time and, as a result, new issues become salient and as these changes to the party occur an individuals noncompliant preferences are disproportionately culled and replaced with preferences that comport with the partisan ID.

Lewis-Beck, Jacoby, Norpoth, &amp; Weisberg [(U. of Mich. Press)](https://www.press.umich.edu/338457/american_voter_revisited) duplicated Campbell *et al.'s* findings using election survey data from 2000 and 2004. There is pretty extensive body of literature building on *The American Voter* in the political science literature.

I should also point out that in political science the Michigan Model (Campbell *et al.* and Lewis-Beck *et al.* are from U. of Mich.) supplanted the Columbia model of Lazarsfeld and Berelson [(wikisum)](http://wikisum.com/w/Berelson%2C_Lazarsfeld%2C_and_McPhee:_Voting) which argued that group association was the most significant factor driving our preferences. There are still some authors (such as Dianne Mutz; [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Hearing-Other-Side-Deliberative-Participatory/dp/0521612284/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1508038950&amp;sr=1-1&amp;refinements=p_27%3ADiana+C.+Mutz)) who argue for the importance of group association but they are a small minority of political scientists. 

Rational choice theorists of the Chicago and Rochester schools argue that preferences form in direct response to the needs (perceived or real; information). Thus, our preferences are for the most utility maximizing alternative. Although, the empirical evidence of this at the individual level of analysis is pretty weak and questions of uncertainty pose a real problem for proponents of rational choices models (not that they haven't tried to address these issues).

"Skill-biased technical change (SBTC) has not been a good description of what's happening in most Western countries for the last couple of decades. What we've observed is job polarization, where well-paid jobs grow, middle-pay jobs shrink, and low-paid jobs grow slightly or stay unchanged. 

This is generally attributed to task-biased technical change (TBTC), which says that routine tasks are most easily automated, abstract tasks are complementary with technology (as in SBTC), and service jobs are not really affected by technology. Since routine tasks (manufacturing, bookkeeping) tend to be in middle-pay jobs, and service tasks (cleaning, waiting tables) are in the bottom of the pay distribution, technological change results in polarization.

Given that recent advances in AI can do more and more non-routine tasks, this is likely to start changing soon. I expect more job displacement in high-pay jobs, for example finance, because the savings from automation are largest there.

I'm on the phone, but if anyone's interested I can supply the relevant citations later. The best place to start is probably looking through David Autor's CV. ",,,,standard_error,,,1508055820,t5_2sml9,t3_76f87g,t1_dodriwv,3,1509845604,0,0,doe3sbb,AskSocialScience,,,

Also it's weird you followed this with that:

GDP per capita isn't a good indicator of personal wealth within the country being measured. 

They are completely unrelated.

But that doesn't tell the whole story either, as Qatar has very generous social programs that saudi lacks. Also, Saudi has a robust military, and due its size, has far more civilian infrastructure that has to be maintained, and a much larger bureaucracy that has to be funded, meaning that saudi has to stretch what's left of its budget over far more citizens than Qatar, which due to its small size (only one major city) and tiny population can allot more of its budget to 'wealth distribution'.

"It’s actually become relatively simple for anyone with some machining experience to illegally manufacture their own weapon.   There is only one component of an AR-15 that is serialized - the lower receiver. You can change the barrel or upper receiver on “the gun” without issue because in the ATF’s eyes, “the gun” only refers to the lower receiver. “Unfinished Lowers” are unfinished, untracked and most importantly UNSERIALIZED versions of the lower receiver.  But,  when milled out and finished they become functioning lower receivers. By law, the person who “finishes” that lower receiver becomes the manufacturer and they are required to register the weapon, receive or declare a serial number, and stamp that serial number into the receiver. If you don’t register the weapon, intentionally or not, you are in possession of an illegally manufactured firearm.

"There are a few issues here. 1) The CDC is prevented from carrying out or funding research related to firearms. 2) The ATF is prevented from maintaining or using any kind of electronic records when it comes to things like weapon trace requests. 3) Other research/statistical organizations within gov are extremely hesitant to do any research on firearms after seeing what the NRA did to CDC and ATF: ""The National Institute of Justice, an arm of the U.S. Department of Justice, funded 32 gun-related studies from 1993 to 1999, but none from 2009-2013"" ([source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2015/01/14/why-the-cdc-still-isnt-researching-gun-violence-despite-the-ban-being-lifted-two-years-ago/)).          
Then, as others are starting to get into, when you say ""got them illegally"" that is a pretty narrow set of possabilities. The only one I can really think of would be convicted felons in possession of a firearm (terms of which vary by state). Other possible scenario I guess would be stolen firearms (though typically family member 'stealing' firearm from another to carry it out) Otherwise it is pretty much legal except for a few other---much less common---scenarios.               
http://wonder.cdc.gov has data available for cause of death and firearms. You can use that to measure trends and compare it to state law changes---like how D.C.'s restrictive gun laws in 2001-2002 caused a massive drop in firearm deaths (two-thirds reduction) until they were effectively axed piece by piece starting in 2012 when new ordinances had to be put in place due to *D.C. vs Heller (2008)* and other court rulings. So now the firearm death rate per 100k is up about 70% in 3 years.

"**[Gun violence and Suicide]**

I would distinguish interpersonal firearm violence and firearm suicides, but I would take both into consideration when studying the topic of gun ownersip and gun violence in general.

The reason I would distinguish those two is because there is a preponderance of evidence that greater accessibility to guns increases the risk of suicide by gun (you can read [this brochure](http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/H-Research_Notes/SAS-Research-Note-44.pdf) for a brief overview) and because there are more firearm suicides than other firearm violence:

&gt; In the United States, there are more firearm suicides than firearm homicides, and women, children, and older adults are more likely to die by gunfire from a  house hold gun (typically, legally acquired and possessed) than from illegal guns ([Miller, Azrael and Hemenway, 2013](https://jhupress.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/1421411113_updf.pdf)).

Furthermore, evidence collected about situational prevention suggests that reducing gun availability could reduce suicide, gun-related or otherwise, since displacement (method substitution) isn't an inevitability [see for example (Clarke and Mayhew, 1988)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1147403). You can find several studies showing the effectiveness of reducing suicide by reducing gun availability.

In summary, there are strong arguments to be made about promoting a public health policy that reduces suicide by 
tackling the issue of gun ownership.

The evidence is more contested regarding interpersonal firearm violence and the effectiveness of gun control legislation. I'll just quote[ Alpers \(2013\)](https://jhupress.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/1421411113_updf.pdf):

&gt;The evidence is clear that following gun law reform, Australians became many times less likely to be killed with a firearm (Alpers, Wilson, and Rossetti 2013a). That said, causality and standards of proof are as contentious in Australia as in any community polarized by the gun debate. Central to the differing interpretations is that Australia’s gun death rates were already declining prior to its major public health interventions. Taking this into account, one study concluded nevertheless that “the rates per 100,000 of total firearm deaths, firearm homicides and firearm suicides all at least doubled their existing rates of decline after the revised gun laws”(Chapman, Alpers, et al. 2006).

There is evidence to suggest that the lack of displacement is also true for interpersonal firearm violence, at least in regards to Australia: 

&gt;[...] the data show that there is no evidence of method substitution for either suicide or homicide. [\(Chapman, Alpers,
 Aghos and Jones, 2006\)](http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/12/6/365))

According to Alpers (2013) that is ""one conclusion [that] has gone uncontested"".

**[Factors in gun violence]**

That's a bit of a broad question. Gender and age are two variables that are important to take into account:

&gt;Males are more likely to be victims of homicide than females, and they are even more likely to be killed by firearms [...] Young adults and adolescents are disproportionately victimized by firearm-related homicide. ([Wllford, Pepper and Petrie, 2004](http://www.hawaiidefensefoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/10881.pdf))

Depends on what you want to know and study. You can check the works I've linked to see the different statistics and correlations according to litterature.

"You kind of learn your own attractiveness based on feedback from your attempts to pair with potential mates.  An increase in your attractiveness that you then learn through feedback would raise the level of attractiveness you believe you are capable of attaining in a mate.  

So say that you thought the best you could get in a mate is a 5 on a 1-10 scale...then you greatly improve your physical appearance which is part of attractiveness.  You start getting attention from 6-7's on that scale, you will raise your target attractiveness goal to 7 for example.  You'll always find a perfect 10 attractive by definition, but unless you think of yourself as a 10 from their perspective, you don't believe it's possible to pair with them. 

I'm still trying to locate it, but I saw a documentary probably on PBS that showed this concept in an experiment where participants had a number from 1-10 taped to their forehead.  They didn't know what their own number was.  They had to partner up with someone who had a number as high as they could get.  The participants learned what their number was on their forehead as they attempted to pair up with people and were rejected by those with higher numbers.  They slowly reduced their target number to a point that they were able to get someone to agree to pair with them.

"There is no force involved with this process per se. Gender will cease to be a social category at all, it will simply be an unintelligible and socially meaningless form of categorization. Before modernity, the concept of sexual orientation did not exist. There were men who were attracted to men and women who were attracted to women but society did not conceive of these people in terms of sexual orientations as ""gay"" or ""straight."" The concept simply did not exist, it was unintelligible. In this context, questions you are raising such as ""What if I want to categorize people in this way? Am I still allowed to?"" aren't really relevant because such categories are *not even a part of social consciousness.* 

Gender abolition is not about creating laws determining that people should no longer be legally registered as one gender or another. It is a situation in which gender *as a social phenomenon* ceases to exist, gender is no longer a social fact. If this still proves elusive to you, then I think before delving into theories of gender abolition you need to look into social construction of gender. It is impossible to understand the concept of the abolition of gender without understanding how gender is part of *social* consciousness and not an inherent category.

"For the OP, something to consider is that marital disruption (i.e. divorce) is somewhat correlated to the rise in women's rights and feminine liberation...which in turn is correlated to increased promiscuity (or at least increased openness of it). Basically, over the last few generations, marriages as a whole (in America) have become more unstable due in large part to shifting attitudes towards traditional gender roles in a family and in the work place. *At the same time*, birth control has made casual sex a less dangerous prospect, and while slut-shaming is absolutely still a thing, there is *much* less pressure on women to not have, or to hide, premarital sexual activity.

"I'll be quite blunt in that I'm a little on the promiscuous side. Up until a few decades ago, that wouldn't have been so feasible, because of the difficulty in obtaining or lack of birth control.

I also happen to not have much interest in a long-term relationship and don't pursue one, choosing to focus on my hobbies and my career.

As a woman, though, the latter would not really have been an option for me prior to the last two decades or so. I would've been strongly pressured to pursue and maintain a relationship/marriage, whether I wanted to or not. With marriage to a ""good"" man being my only real way to living a comfortable life, I would've put a lot more work into a relationship I may not otherwise have cared about. But today, I'm not dependent on a husband, so if I don't want a relationship, I can leave it or choose not to have it in the first place.

"I think you need to bear in mind that from the point of view of our current society a genderless society is utopian, and utopias are inherently revolutionary and not something anyone expects to happen overnight. It would be very hard, if not impossible, for you or I, or anyone else alive today to truly abolish gender in our heads, given how entrenched it is in our culture and our psychology. But if you were *born* into a genderless society, you would not have grown up defining yourself as ""a boy"" or ""a man"", you wouldn't sort the people around you into ""men"" and ""women"", and you wouldn't conceptualise your sexuality with reference to those concepts. If you had a strong sexual preference for one physical sex over another, that would be considered a preference rather than identity. Hypothetically ending up in bed with someone who doesn't have the equipment you expected would be an awkward but not calamitous situation. Maybe they'd make sitcoms about it. 

As with any form of utopianism, thinking about how we'd get there is a lot harder than theorising the destination. You could imagine a nightmarish scenario of imposed degenderisation, with entrenched 'identifiers' like you being sent to re-education camps. Or you could not. It's all pie-in-the-sky at the moment.

"Well, I think the case of the Google memo is a perfect example of what you're talking about when you said ""it can reinforce normative views and stereotyping of said groups."" 

Damore relied mostly on [evolutionary psychology.](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3914586/Googles-Ideological-Echo-Chamber.pdf)

&gt; On average, men and women biologically differ in many ways. These differences aren’t just socially constructed because:
● They’re universal across human cultures
● They often have clear biological causes and links to prenatal testosterone
● Biological males that were castrated at birth and raised as females often still identify and act like males
● The underlying traits are highly heritable
● They’re exactly what we would predict from an **evolutionary psychology perspective**

Evolutionary psychology is a popular subject for popsci because it often deals in particularly sexy topics, and it's used as a source by pick-up artist communities and other entities in the man-o-sphere because there's a natural symbiosis there. If women can be understood in terms of how they're ""hard-wired"" biologically, then means can be found to exploit that. For example, professional bro Tucker Max co-authored a book with University of New Mexico evolutionary psychology professor Geoffrey Miller, who was coincidentally one of four ""scientists"" Quillette cited as supporting Damore. Also he took flack for [fat-shaming his grad students.](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/08/07/fat-shaming-professor-faces-censure-university)

Evolutionary psychology, like psychometrics, is a branch of psychology that is a lightning rod for crackpots of all kinds. It has been specifically abused by a psychologist named [Kevin B MacDonald](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/kevin-macdonald), whom the SLPC called ""Neo-Nazis' favorite academic.""  MacDonald's work has focused on Jewish behavior as a ""group evolutionary survival strategy."" If that sounds like an academic way of paraphrasing classic fascist canards, it's because it is. It reminds me of a quote by Umberto Eco, who said that ""We were always told the Jews helped each other through a secret web of mutual assistance.""

But the real risk is not just that laypeople will misunderstand valid science and come to the wrong conclusions. It's that the science itself is shaky and people might give too much credence to studies that don't warrant it.

I think many people don't understand what a study means, which is partially due to poor science reporting. A single study is reported as if it is the new truth, when that's not how science (especially social science) works. There's not enough scientific literacy among the general public about concepts like replication and literature review, so you read reports on studies every other day saying coffee is killing you or that coffee is great for your health. And when it comes to specific studies that shape one's worldview—on say race or sex—people just pick the one they want to believe.

And evolutionary psychology is particularly vulnerable to this phenomenon because it's a young field. Science progresses—not always linearly—from uncertainty to certainty. Social science research is particularly time consuming and labor intensive since it requires forming a representative sample, conducting surveys/collecting data, analyzing the data and drawing conclusions. And often to do a study right, this should be a longitudinal process that could take a decade or several. 

So in order to get valid evidence that researchers have a high level of confidence in, you have to go through this process over and over for years. Frankly, there aren't enough people doing evolutionary psychology and the ones who have, haven't been doing it long. And a few that are were caught [falsifying their data.](https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-rise-of-the-evolutionary-psychology-douchebag-757550990)

Long story short: There's not large enough body of evidence to say with any sort of certainty that this or that hypothesis is supported, and to do so is irresponsible, yet many laypeople will do just that.

So to answer your question, yes evolutionary psychology is dangerous in the hands of laypeople, especially those who don't understand the limitations of social science in general, and the discipline in particular.

"First of all, great response. I want to quibble a bit with the assertion that Damore ""mostly"" relied on evolutionary psychology, though. He only refers to evolutionary psychology twice;¹ most of his argument is based on heritable/biological sex differences. That's not evolutionary psychology, and Damore largely doesn't refer to evolutionary psychology literature.

I also don't think evolutionary psychology being a young field has an impact on the reliability of findings. Replicability is an issue across subdisciplines of psychology, and their age certainly doesn't seem to be the decisive factor in which disciplines fare better.

(That said: evolutionary psychology is not that young, and to say that ""the ones who have, haven't been doing it long"" is simply nonsense - there's enough evolutionary psychologists who are long emeritus now.

"Elaborating on a bit of a tangent here, I'm glad you brought up psychometrics.

My opinion is that differential psychology is at least as dangerous, if not more dangerous than evolutionary psychology. Differential psychology, also known as quantitative psychology, is built on the application of psychometric theory and is also arguably the dominant paradigm in American psychology.

It seems the subtlety and difficulty of the statistical arguments in support of hypotheses in differential psychology causes more confusion than enlightenment. Very few people are equipped with the conceptual tools to consume psychometric information gainfully and communicate it responsible. Even among professional psychologists, those with the ability required are a small minority.



I agree 100% with you on:

&gt;But the real risk is not just that laypeople will misunderstand valid science and come to the wrong conclusions. It's that the science itself is shaky and people might give too much credence to studies that don't warrant it.

The basic evidence for group differences come from differential/quantitative psychologists who make very subtle and weak statistical claims that are easily mistaken for much stronger and more straight forward claims about differences between people. 

Once a difference is empirically ""established"", evolutionary psychologists can go to town on evolutionary just-so-stories to explain the existence of these empirical ""findings"". These stories are often very difficult to either support or falsify with further evidence.

This process can easily drive home beliefs of differences between individual members of different groups where all that was shown to exist are *statistically significant* differences in *group statistics* which are difficult to understand, interpret or make intuitive sense of. 

These beliefs may drive misguided or dangerous social actions.

For anyone interested in the subtle conceptual difficulties in psychometrics, I highly recommend Borsboom's [Measuring the Mind: Conceptual Issues in Contemporary Psychometrics (2005)](https://www.amazon.com/Measuring-Mind-Conceptual-Contemporary-Psychometrics/dp/0521102847) and Michell's [Measurement in Psychology: A Critical History of a Methodological Concept (1999)](https://www.amazon.com/Measuring-Mind-Conceptual-Contemporary-Psychometrics/dp/0521102847).

"This would seemingly support OPs observation: perhaps shunning of use of certain curses correlates with emotional impact. That is, the social unacceptability of such words is in relation to how effective they are at eliciting emotional responses. That's even seems testable. I wonder if there have been any studies.

For example, using the word 'fuck' is OK at a construction site because it will not elicit strong emotion, and thus, it isn't banned. But use it at church and there will be much scandal.

[CITE] Minton, EA, &amp; Cornwell, TB 2016. The Cause Cue Effect: Cause-Related Marketing and Consumer Health Perceptions. JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS 50 (2) 372-402.

[ABSTRACT] Many for-profit companies (e.g., Kraft, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Keebler, 5-Hour Energy) are partnering with health-oriented nonprofits (e.g., Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Susan G. Komen for Breast Cancer Research, American Red Cross) to make purchase-contingent donations. Companies use cause-related marketing to improve brand image and goodwill for their food products and companies. Prior research has examined how food-related cues can create consumer misperceptions; however, consumer perceptions related to corporate communications (e.g., the use of cause cues) has received little research attention. This research explores consumer reactions to cause cues and finds that adding a health cause to a food package significantly increases product health perceptions, and, usually, product attitude, and purchase intentions (i.e., the cause cue effect) in both a student sample (Studies 1 and 2) and an adult sample on Amazon's mTurk (Study 3). Implications for cueing and inference-making literature, and for consumer health, and policymakers are discussed.

[BACK TO ME] There are potentially complex relationships. For example, overall awareness campaigns might generate donations or other sources of funding that enable advocacy organizations to lobby for funds for research or public policy. The ubiquity of ""the ribbon"" might prompt politicians to take the cause seriously. Adoption of a ribbon by individuals could be associated with future, measurably effective advocacy or donating. Adoption of the ribbon in sympathy with the cause might be associated with enhanced uptake of screening at the individual level. There are a myriad of decent research questions.

Most of the examples have to do with sports teams. While the link I give is not a scientific publication, it contains citations and links to the foundational theory documents by Tajfel, Devine, and Brewer. 

These short readings are very accessible and topical to your question. I would go so far as to say that Social Identity is the major explanatory body of theory, at least in social psych, for the kinds of phenomena you describe.

"The question reminded me of a paper that, while primarily focused on  exploring Lancan's notion of *extimacy*, does so by unpacking the meanings of military support themed ribbon magnets.

Kingsbury, P., 2007. The extimacy of space. Social &amp; Cultural Geography, 8(2), pp.235-258.

Abstract:

Jacques Lacan coined the neologism ‘extimacy’ (extimité) in order to theorize two interrelated modes of psychical apprehension: first, how our most intimate feelings can be extremely strange and Other to us. Second, how our feelings can be radically externalized on to objects without losing their sincerity and intensity. Attending to the socio-spatial dimensions of extimacy, this paper provides insight into the importance of topology in Lacan's work. In so doing, the paper challenges the enduring doxa in geography that Lacanian theories ultimately devalue the intricacies and liveliness of space. To substantiate this claim, **I explore the extimacy of the most popular vehicle accessory in the USA since the 1980s' ‘Baby on Board’ signs: the ‘ribbon magnet’. Specifically, I elaborate the extimate contours of two ribbon magnet slogans, ‘Half Of My Heart Is In Iraq’ and ‘I Support More Troops Than You’.** Affirming a recent critique that social and cultural geographers have ‘tamed’ psychoanalysis, that is, shied away from working through psychoanalysis's allegedly unseemly conceptualizations of politics and subjectivity, this paper suggests that we have yet to catch up with some of psychoanalysis's most fundamental and valuable theorizations about space itself.",,,,lazarescu,,,1509406340,t5_2sml9,t3_79n4mr,t1_dp3i0sr,1,1510341121,0,0,dp497o9,AskSocialScience,,,

League of Legends is (or was) widely regarded as one of the most toxic online communities in games. Riot Games, the developer of League of Legends, did eventually start temporarily and permanently banning toxic players. The first issue is the slow response. It takes resources, and therefore money, to review game logs to verify reports of toxic players, and generally developers are slow to respond, often taking days and weeks to actually take action against players. 

Secondly, the game itself is free to play, so players could just create another account to circumvent a ban. They'd lose progression, and whatever add-ons they'd purchased on their banned accounts, but they often can just get right back into the game. Developers can, and do, ban player IP addresses if they are caught circumventing a ban. This too can be bypassed by players crafty enough, or in control of their ISP contract. They could order a new modem, and thus get a new IP. They could contact their ISP and ask for a new address. Or failing that, could play through a VPN service, though this causes game performance losses. 

Thirdly, companies need players to make money, and so are not motivated to self police until it becomes detrimental to their income. 

This also isn't unique to games. See the humorous origins of SomethingAwful.com's ten dollar forum account registration fee that they somewhat humorously turned banned users who insisted on returning, even at the cost of ten dollars per account, into a revenue stream to support the site.

"Isn't it strange that often, the same people would argue that the deregulation of drugs would lead to increased supply, lower prices and a larger number of addicts? The [cognitive dissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance) must be vexing.

You are correct in your presumption. If gun control is more strictly enforced, reducing the number of legally purchased guns, this would reduce the supply of guns available on the black market, which would raise prices and reduce quantities. The same would follow if guns were more strictly and closely tracked during manufacturing, distribution, and sale. 

A recent well known study, [Kleck G, Wang S-YK. The myth of big-time gun trafficking and the overinterpretation of gun tracing data. UCLA Law Rev. 2009;56:1233–1294.](http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/uclalr56&amp;div=36), states:

""In places where there are more gun owners, there are more guns sold by licensed dealers, and eventually more guns stolen and found in the possession of criminals.""

The study's main conclusion is that most guns obtained illegally are not obtained from large scale gun traffickers. Rather, criminals obtain guns through multiple diverse pathways (small scale theft, crooked gun dealers, buyers, gun shows). Tightening the regulation and control of guns would significantly reduce these channels.

"There was a study done by a school teacher, Jane Elliot, in the 60s showing that children  in the ""outcast"" group were not really any more sympathetic to outsiders despite ""knowing how it feels"".  I would theorize that part (only a part) of the toxic environment issue is that many people in the gaming community were social outcasts and these feelings of being excluded have made them bitter towards others who were not outcasts like themselves.  They want the gaming community to be exclusive so that they also feel like they are part of an in-group. They promote this by being very selective with whom they allow in.  It's not a big secret that women are often times targeted as not being allowed to be a part of the gaming community, but many other groups of people are as well.   This is a defense to keep the (perceived) people who excluded them in their past, from joining their own little special group that they belong to now.

The same pattern is seen throughout a lot of similar situations.  The people who hated the way the system worked to exclude them are also continuing the same behaviors by creating their own groups and excluding those they blamed for their feelings of ""not being accepted"".  This in of itself is not necessarily a bad thing (ragtime music), but it can foster a toxic environment as it does with your example. (African-American examples are well known so I am using them)

This even happens sometimes in civil rights groups, like the Black Panthers who did a lot of good but also were an exclusive group.  When this happens, it perpetuates the separation of groups and actually promotes in-group and out-group bias and prejudice.   

I know this is slightly away from your original question, but in a round about way it is still a basic pattern seen in groups.

"African Americans were excluded from being a part of the majority recreational activities.  They were not allowed to go to bars and dance halls.  Because of this exclusion they formed their own clubs and places to hang out.   This is the history of ragtime music. It was born in these places that African Americans created for their group since they were excluded from being a part of the majority's places. 


Of course, these started out as a place for African Americans but the music was becoming more popular and white people also wanted to experience it.   The African Americans had pretty much zero power to exclude (unlike the gaming community) And couldn't really keep it exclusive. It's likely some wanted to share it and some did not. But that's besides the point. 


The creation of ragtime music came about because an excluded group of people decided they were going to make a place for themselves. A place for black people.  Where they could have their own in-group.  Feel valued and respected. 

Jazz and rock and roll are credited with having their beginnings in the black culture of America.

"No, they are not. Basically there's a split within the existentialist school of thought, where some include God (Tillich, Jasper, Kierkegaard, Marcel, Barth) and some argue that the existence of choice must exclude God (Sartre, Heidegger, Nietzsche). 

According to Sartre: ""The question is only complicated because there are two kinds of existentialists. There are, on the one hand, the Christians, amongst whom I shall name Jaspers and Gabriel Marcel, both professed Catholics; and on the other the existential atheists, amongst whom we must place Heidegger as well as the French existentialists and myself. What they have in common is simply the fact that they believe that existence comes before essence– or, if you will, that we must begin from the subjective. What exactly do we mean by that?

If one considers an article of manufacture as, for example, a book or a paper-knife – one sees that it has been made by an artisan who had a conception of it; and he has paid attention, equally, to the conception of a paper-knife and to the pre-existent technique of production which is a part of that conception and is, at bottom, a formula. Thus the paper-knife is at the same time an article producible in a certain manner and one which, on the other hand, serves a definite purpose, for one cannot suppose that a man would produce a paper-knife without knowing what it was for. Let us say, then, of the paperknife that its essence – that is to say the sum of the formulae and the qualities which made its production and its definition possible – precedes its existence. The presence of such-and-such a paper-knife or book is thus determined before my eyes. Here, then, we are viewing the world from a technical standpoint, and we can say that production precedes existence.

When we think of God as the creator, we are thinking of him, most of the time, as a supernal artisan. Whatever doctrine we may be considering, whether it be a doctrine like that of Descartes, or of Leibnitz himself, we always imply that the will follows, more or less, from the understanding or at least accompanies it, so that when God creates he knows precisely what he is creating. Thus, the conception of man in the mind of God is comparable to that of the paper-knife in the mind of the artisan: God makes man according to a procedure and a conception, exactly as the artisan manufactures a paper-knife, following a definition and a formula. Thus each individual man is the realisation of a certain conception which dwells in the divine understanding. In the philosophic atheism of the eighteenth century, the notion of God is suppressed, but not, for all that, the idea that essence is prior to existence; something of that idea we still find everywhere, in Diderot, in Voltaire and even in Kant. 

Man possesses a human nature; that “human nature,” which is the conception of human being, is found in every man; which means that each man is a particular example of a universal conception, the conception of Man. In Kant, this universality goes so far that the wild man of the woods, man in the state of nature and the bourgeois are all contained in the same definition and have the same fundamental qualities. Here again, the essence of man precedes that historic existence which we confront in experience.

Atheistic existentialism, of which I am a representative, declares with greater consistency that if God does not exist there is at least one being whose existence comes before its essence, a being which exists before it can be defined by any conception of it. That being is man or, as Heidegger has it, the human reality. What do we mean by saying that existence precedes essence? We mean that man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world – and defines himself afterwards. If man as the existentialist sees him is not definable, it is because to begin with he is nothing. He will not be anything until later, and then he will be what he makes of himself. Thus, there is no human nature, because there is no God to have a conception of it. Man simply is. Not that he is simply what he conceives himself to be, but he is what he wills, and as he conceives himself after already existing – as he wills to be after that leap towards existence. Man is nothing else but that which he makes of himself.""

"That quote leaves one wondering though, how can one believe in God and simultaneously reject that essence precedes existence? Is it because Existential Christians merely _choose_ to believe in God, on account of pure faith, instead of believing that he necessarily exists? And thus Existential Christians are not born Christian nor have a human nature as defined by God, but merely choose to define themselves as Christians who act _as if they would have_ a human nature as defined by God?

Once you add a modifier in front of something good, it becomes a perversion of itself. ""sociological critical thinking"" by definition, is not all critical thinking, and therefore it cannot be critical thinking, as it cannot fulfill the term sufficiently enough to encompass all of it; it's a perversion of itself.

Imagine if there existed ""phenomenological critical thinking"" and ""religious critical thinking"" how discombobulated arguments between people who understand critical thinking differently would be?

There does not exist any critical thinking other than itself. It's a thinking that is all-encompassing and you cannot have only some of it and be able to say that you can think critically; that is perverted as it's not a value sufficiently enough to fulfill the term completely.

"OP, with all due respect to above posters - you should ignore any posts which circle back around to an earlier period in capitalism. That's just the the same thing. Consumption and production is of commodities is the modus operandi of capitalism. The advanced [commodity fetishism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_fetishism) of late capitalism is what people critique, but it's only a symptom of a system which is unsustainable.

In answer to your question, what you're seeking is the form of society which preceded capitalism, which is feudalism. Instead of the 1% of today, there was a monarchal/aristocratic tier of people who owned and inherited lands/wealth, and serfs (non land-owners) worked for their ability to occupy the land. 

In terms of *culture*, it depends on how you wish to define it, and what qualities, for you, count as culture. But reach into any history book to look at feudal society and you'll see the difference in how people lived.

If you're looking for an interesting take on the difference between these periods, I would look at Karl Marx. In his essay, [German Ideology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_German_Ideology) Karl Marx outlines his theory of [dialectical materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx%27s_theory_of_history) in which he says the history of the world has been subject to several epochs, each centred around a dominant form of property. 

While capitalism has its ills, so did feudalism. In fact, for many commentators, social scientists and philosophers, capitalism is an improvement as it allows ""upward social mobility"", i.e. the ability for any person, in theory, to work hard and live at a station above which they were born.

"At a certain point the government loses control of inflation even if it did stop printing money, this is called inertial inflation.

As money is rapidly devalued, current inflation is used to forecast future inflation. Employees understandably want continuously increased wages written in their contracts to match inflation forecasts, the employees continuously raise the price of goods to match the increasing cost of workers. The price of everything keeps going up and the value of money keeps falling regardless of government action.

In a field that's pretty heavily mathematical, you'll find clear and lucid exposition on the inner workings of some of the most important and influential models still in use in economics when it comes to decision making under uncertainty, written at a level that's graspable with a modicum of effort, even if you have no idea what Choquet integration is all about!

The irony of this arrangement is that central banks, in response to 2008, used their political independence to inject massive amounts of politically-unpopular (in the sense that normal political processes would not have resulted in them) stimulus. The original argument for central bank independence is the fear that politicians would use inflationary growth to boost short-term re-election chances.

"I can see three components to this question:

Theoretical:

1) Will supply rise to meet demand, regardless of a small supplier's willingness to supply?

Empirical:

2) If a small producer reduces its production of oil, what effect does that have on global consumption of oil (elasticity of oil demand)? Which countries gain market share from the small producer's withdrawal?

3) Are our country's oil/fur production standards higher than those of other countries according to some set of measures? How much good does that do?

Let's say we believe that supply will rise to meet demand, but demand is not inelastic. If our country reduces production of oil by 100 barrels, someone else will come in and supply 80 barrels at a higher cost. However, those 80 barrels are being produced in a way that harms the environment and funds dictatorships. 

What we need to do is find a way to measure the marginal benefit of our country producing a barrel and weigh that against the marginal amount of oil that is burned because we produced it.

Ultimately, I am not sure that the empirical answer to these questions will do much to clarify the moral argument, but there is a lot of literature on all of these questions.",,,,racornist,,,1507840013,t5_2sml9,t3_75y2uf,t1_doa1dbj,16,1509772515,0,0,doa5qbk,AskSocialScience,,,

This is actually a really simple topic to Google despite your bad attitude, OP.

&gt;In a recent study involving 4,018 participants conducted in the Netherlands, the prevalence of picky eating was 26.5% at 18 months of age, 27.6% at 3 years of age, and declined to 13.2% at 6 years of age 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4422022/

&gt;Parental perception of their children’s pickiness with food ranges from 20% to 50%, based on studies in the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, and China.(1,2) In Singapore, nearly half of surveyed parents (including caregivers) perceived their child as a picky eater, and a third of them would consult a doctor about their child’s eating behaviour.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4291945/

&gt;Picky eating has generally been studied in populations from developed countries, predominantly the USA, but this narrowness has been criticised as disregarding the effect of the mother's cultural background on feeding practices (Jani Mehta et al., 2014). However, Indian immigrants into Australia showed similar associations to those in European origin populations, namely that pressure-feeding and perceptions of pickiness were positively related (Jani Mehta et al., 2014). In addition, the prevalence of picky eating in these immigrants and in a Turkish population was similar to that in developed countries (Jani Mehta et al., 2014; Orun et al., 2012). Despite these findings, the number of studies investigating picky eating in developing countries is limited and further work is needed to confirm these results.

"I would guess it’s because sociology is multiparadigmatic in a way that, say, economics isn’t. Economics has its dominant paradigm (neoclassical or the marginalist revolution or whatever) and then two clear minority paradigms. You don’t read the original people really, but you still learn tiny bits about some important thinkers: every undergrad knows about Pareto equilibriums, every undergrad knows about Ricardo’s theory of international trade (comparative advantage), everyone knows about Smith’s invisible hand. But these are all didactic exercises. Modern theories of international trade are far more complex than Pareto’s; Nobel prized winner Paul Krugman has a great little essay called “[Ricardo’s difficult idea](http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/ricardo.htm)”. People have gone back to Smith’s original text and realized he only mentions “the invisible hand” three times. It’s not an idea developed by Smith, really, but something later scholars have gone back and developed and attributed to Smith. They use Smith to teach contemporary ideas. 

Sociology was very much like that with the three greats. Marx was used to teach conflict theory, Durkheim functionalism, Weber symbolic interactionism. Those were the three mid-century sociology paradigms and, while they have mostly melted away as independent schools of thought, they do a good job covering much of the ground that sociologists cover. Likewise, they do a good job of covering a lot of basic concepts: we get group conflict from Marx; solidarity from Durkheim; and individual action going up to group action in Weber (and Durkheim’s suicide). Marx and Durkheim use figures (*Suicide* is all statistics), Marx and Weber use historic change, and Durkheim and arguably Weber use ethnography (Durkheim most clearly in *Elementary Forms*), and so forth.

Economics also you learn basic things and have clear building blocs.  You start with simple models (now mostly microeconomic based) and build up from there adding layers of complications. It’s cumulative, especially in the first year or two, in a way that most sociology teaching is just not. 

Sociology can’t do that because sociology is just much more diverse, not only in terms of paradigms, but in terms of subject matter. The main alternative I’ve seen to “teaching through the classics” at the intro level is teaching “the sociology of”s. Start with the sociology of X, move to the sociology of Y. There’s a few alternative ways to do it  (I met someone who taught the course entirely through method and concept: this is an example of population, this is an example of a rate, this is an example of a social class, etc. and built up like that) but sociology just doesn’t have a center like economics does. 

It’s interesting, but I think until recently anthropology too taught mainly through the classics (I think until roughly the 80’s, when post-colonialism etc changed what it meant to do anthropology), and political science still often begins through the classics, even in non-political theory classes. All political scientists will read Rousseau, Hobbes, Dewey, etc. They even sometimes use them to label paradigms: international relations scholars sometimes use Hobbes to stand in for realism, Rousseau to stand in for... I think liberalism, Locke to stand in for something else. I forget precisely, it came up a few times in things I learned; it’s clearly one way to talk about it, but not *the* way to talk about it or teach it. 

Still, political science and anthropology courses are often structured like sociology courses, in that many times you read these very old classical works in the first weeks of a class, and then much more recent works by the end. Economics, as far as I know, often only goes back to the 80s when it’s building cumulatively on a subject (its interesting because very often in sociology, you’ll skip from about Weber to the 90s-it goes very much classic to contemporary very fast), though it seems like that’s increasingly being dispensed with, at least outside of very elite universities. When I learned sociology of religion, for instance, I started with selections of Marx, Weber, Durkheim, then Geertz (anthropologist), then Asad (anthropologist), then we moved into contemporary works. That’s also how we taught it at my graduate school. Here [you can see a similar class, though with a little less emphasis on the classics than I saw](https://www.coloradocollege.edu/dotAsset/dfcb2998-5fe2-48bd-8319-ffcf7bf733a3.pdf) (in part, no doubt, because they rely on a textbook, which both my undergrad and grad school didn’t really ever use in sociology). That may be part of it as well: it’s easier to skip the classics once you’re unmoored from the texts and completely or mostly reliant on a textbook. I don’t know ultimately how connected the two are, however, because textbooks used to very important to sociology, especially in the immediate post war period when the cannon became firmly fixed.

"[If your J is intended to mean ""Jew.""](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/05/books/review/einsteins-jewish-science-by-steven-gimbel.html)

&gt;It’s no wonder Nazis hated relativity. They lived in a world of absolutes. There was a master race with one true religion and one true language, with a music and literature that celebrated its glory. There was a true German empire, sliced up by the arbitrary boundaries of concoctions called nation-states. With absolute might the Fatherland would regain its proper position in space and time.

&gt;Now comes this Einstein. Without even the benefit of a proper German education, he was fiddling with numbers and symbols and through some kabbalistic magic conjuring a universe in which it was impossible to say where you were. You could only describe your position in relationship to something else — which could only describe its position in relationship to you.

I am, of course, not saying that Conservatives are literal Nazis. I'm just reminding people that Nazis are genuine Conservatives. And that Richard Spencer is *extremely* conservative. Why, the man's computer font is probably [Fraktur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraktur). Because, well, it's an old font. Used for classical, traditional books. Like *Mien Kamph.*

EDIT: It is possible I have a downvote fairy. It's also possible that I said something that is breathtakingly judgemental and rude about someone who entirely deserves it. But it's the wrong tone for the room, for which I apologize. 

I don't really feel it's fair to re-write what I said - just imagine I said, politely, that for many people the objection to Cultural Relativism is based on repellent anti-semetic beliefs or rather bizarre understandings of absolute biblical truth. 

/u/Angry_Grammarian's pov about Cultural relativism is something I agree with entirely. But while I do, I don't think that the people yammering on about it from the right are reasoning from that place - and if you assume that they are, you may be giving them far too much credit.",,,,graphictruth,,,1508710144,t5_2sml9,t3_7827xx,t1_doqmowy,-1,1510084486,1,0,doqokxm,AskSocialScience,,,

Maybe Gandhi's essay hind swaraj referencing peace among people being as old as the hills(changing the contemporary notion of history that human interaction is just a series of wars) and wars were rare spectacular events which is why they were recorded. 

Then of course there is insisting of governments to the enforcement of the U.N declaration of human rights. Those cover the spectrum pretty well.

"I would definitely put this question to your professor for the theory class, as they should be able to give you a much better answer to this, particularly around why concepts of consciousness and reality are important to sociological thought.

That said, I think what you're speaking to here is a particularly quantitative view of sociology, that attempts to address a positivistic view of the world. It's important to remember that there is an entire field of qualitative research there as well, which is fundamentally based on an interpretive view of reality (i.e. there are multiple realities). Understanding the notions of consciousness and reality that underlay a lot of sociological thought should help you gain a deeper understanding of these two different perspectives, give you the tools to analyse the benefits and limits of each, and allow you to better analyse the data that you do collect.

This looks like a fairly nice summary of the two paradigms, and the ways of thinking that underline each: http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/136455799295041

"Great question! There is a lot of research regarding unique names in the black community. Distinctively black names became more popular following the Civil Rights Movement. ""[In particular](http://voxeu.org/article/black-names-past-present-and-future), scholars have posited that the rise of distinctively black names may be attributable to the Black Power movement and the later black cultural movement of the 1990s as a way to affirm and embrace black culture, consistent with Akerlof and Kranton’s (2000) economic model of social identity"". 

In other words, it was a way for black people to sort of un-hook themselves from the constraints of whiteness and white culture in order to form their own unique identities.

As for wealthy Mormon families, perhaps that would be a good question for r/exmormon. I am not aware of any research on that (although I am sure it exists).

"This happens all the time!

A great example is European countries, where historically, there have been hundreds or thousands of ethnic groups living in a particular country. However, over time, those particular ethnic distinctions have been forgotten, with everyone instead embracing the idea of ""Dutch,"" ""French,"" or ""German."" This is the product of nationalism, but nationalism can be a powerful force in bringing people together.

An example without nationalism is the Ngoni of southern Africa. As the Ngoni conquered surrounding peoples, they absorbed them into their class structure, first as a lower caste, then integrating them more fully. However, in doing so, Ngoni gods, beliefs, and even names would change as Ngoni adopted things they liked from the groups they conquered. This definitely isn't unique in African history either - southern African groups tended to absorb rather than annihilate each other. 

You can still see this going on with Islam and Christianity in Africa. Rather than the Christianity or Islam you might recognise, the faiths are instead full of recontextualising, with Jesus or Allah taking on a traditional African role and being one among many. It's an extremely common phenomenon for converted peoples to incorporate indigenous beliefs with the converting religion, creating a blend of the two to better contextualise the faith and incorporate it into their identity. It's not quite an example of what you're looking for, but it really highlights why merges happen - people think other people have good ideas and good ways of looking at the world, and blend those ideas together to create a stronger whole.",,,,Quouar,Islam and Human Rights,,1507121283,t5_2sml9,t3_747dyd,t3_747dyd,8,1509295975,0,0,dnw4isb,AskSocialScience,,,polisci

[This](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/265673/what-is-the-difference-between-the-terms-mass-murder-massacre-and-genocid) post goes over the differences between these and similar terms (e.g. the difference between murder and manslaughter). 

[Here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11896-009-9059-6) is a social science paper using these terms in this way: 

* A massacre is defined as ""involving indiscriminate killings in which killing people is the prime aim and victims are chosen by chance from some broad social grouping.""

* Mass murder is defined as the “antisocial and non-state-sponsored killing of multiple victims during a single episode at one or more closely related locations.”

So a massacre is any kind of indiscriminate killing, whereas a mass shooting is one such occurrence where the method of killing is shooting.",,,,Dennis_Langley,,,1507123011,t5_2sml9,t3_747tvr,t3_747tvr,4,1509296614,0,0,dnw5r29,AskSocialScience,,,
"There are many examples of this!

For one, the expansion of the Russian empire from the 15th to 20th centuries eastward from Europe has lead to many Turkic and Finno-urgic people's to identify as ethnically and culturally Russian. 

Another, is that in Argentina where only 1.6% of Argentines identify as Amerindian and most identify culturally as white European. However in actuality, some studies have shown that much of the population is actually genetically mestizo. 

The Goths, Vandals and other German ethnolinguistic groups, were eventually subsumed into the modern German ethnicity. 

The Gauls in pre-Roman Europe were a tribal ethnic group that were subsumed into the invading Roman Empire. Becoming ""Romanized"" (although I hate the use of that word) through imperial conquest and forced subjugation. 

So yes there are many examples of ethnic groups merging and becoming one, or one being subsumed into the other. It has happened all across the world, but for varying reasons. Yes, there are many ethnic groups that strive to protect their linguistic and cultural heritage but given enough time and proximity, and the right historical circumstances, it is not uncommon to see a merging of ethnic groups. I think the biggest thing to wrap your head around is that these are long term historical events. This isn't something that happens in a few generations.

"I'm not sure if you're mixing up some of the arguments here, but as presented, it's wrong in almost every way. First, there is the division between markets and market economies, which Karl Polanyi (among others) makes in The Great Transformation. Market economies are ones in which the market becomes ""disembedded"" from other social institutions and the economy operates primarily on the logic of the price system. Markets, however, can also be ""embedded"" within said institutions. Polanyi's argument is not that markets didn't exist before capitalism, but they became increasingly disembedded during the modern period to the point of creating a full-blown market economy.

The same applies to barter. As someone mentioned above, the argument is not that it never existed pre-capitalism, but that it was not the origin of money. Gift economies, ideas about value and exchange, etc. well predate Graeber going back at least to the debates between [Mauss](https://archive.org/details/giftformsfunctio00maus) and [Malinowski](http://web.mnstate.edu/robertsb/380/kula.pdf). As Graeber notes, we really have no evidence for barter economies among Stone Age hunter-gatherers nor the ethnographic record outside of interaction with agricultural or industrial societies with markets and money. 

Another distinction that needs to be made here is the difference between commodity money (one with ""use-value"" and ""exchange value"" if you wanna get Marxist) and representative money (exchange-value only). So we don't really know when markets and barter emerged, but the earliest form of money is found with the commodity money of early states. Representative currency arises with coinage in 7th century BC Lydia. (You could always melt down the coins into the electrum they were made from, but the coins themselves have no function outside of being a medium of exchange.)

So money and markets existed well before feudalism and capitalism. It's an oversimplification to see the transition from feudalism to capitalism (or mercantilism depending on how you want to separate it out) in western Europe as the ""modern"" forces of enclosure and primitive accumulation sweeping in and blasting away all traces of ""traditional"" feudal societies. 

In An Archaeology of Capitalism, Matthew Johnson locates the roots of the capitalist transition in the late Middle Ages. (If you wanted to really stretch, you might go back to the nascent mercantile classes of Italian city-states.) Johnson notes that peasant farming practices were not homogeneous and that some practices considered ""traditional"" were actually recent introductions. In some places, property rights were fairly well-defined, but simply held together by verbal agreement rather than written contract. In some cases like these, enclosure formalized an already existing relationship.

Johnson differentiates four different types of enclosure: 1, ""General enclosure,"" which is the commonly meant definition as privatization of the commons, 2, ""piecemeal enclosure"" where individual farmers exchanged or consolidated land holdings, 3, ""enclosure of waste,"" the sale of unused or lightly used arable land, and 4, ""parliamentary enclosure,"" which legally formalized acts of enclosure.

This is also, of course, a highly Eurocentric take on things. If you look elsewhere, let's take two of the biggest empires in America for instance, there are very different things going on that don't fit into the traditional stage-based theories. The Aztec empire's economy was centered around barter in addition to the commodity currencies of cacao beans and cotton, with a huge mercantile class. (This may be an exception to Graeber's rule, though I won't say for sure as I'm not well-read on the Aztecs.) In contrast, the Inca had a command economy that ran on what La Lone called the [""supply on command""](https://www.academia.edu/885136/The_Inca_as_a_nonmarket_economy_Supply_on_command_versus_supply_and_demand) or what Murra called the [vertical archipelago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_archipelago) and lacked markets and a mercantile class. Additionally, if you expand out to the Americas as a whole, they were inhabited by an incredible range of societies from hunter-gatherer bands to vast empires, while Europe was much more uniformly dominated by feudalism and the transitions to mercantilism/capitalism.",,,,Snugglerific,,,1507142269,t5_2sml9,t3_744q9y,t3_744q9y,3,1509305949,0,0,dnwnyzz,AskSocialScience,,,

If so, I can offer some speculation.  First, anal sex is reputed to provide more intense sensation than vaginal sex, while condoms diminish sensation.  Thus, the growing use of condoms could increase the male interest in anal sex.  Moreover, condoms would reduce the ""yuck!"" factor, by providing a barrier between the penis and any fecal matter (actual or imagined).",,,,Notmyrealid,,,1508980517,t5_2sml9,t3_78mj1k,t1_dovc3k5,2,1510188411,0,0,dow9f6i,AskSocialScience,,,

"&gt; There is no set ""purpose"", it's a product like anything else so the consumer defines meaning.

Elsewhere in this post is a criticism of Caplan for his overly narrow economic focus but this post opens with a statement that instantly adopts the language of classical economics. Caplan discusses how there are more efficient ways to achieve what he calls a social rate of return on investment but defines what is socially good almost entirely in terms of industrial throughput and the extent to which the educational system is creating economically viable products and workers. The fact that social scientists, in answer to this basic question, feel no need to justify the assumptions that the primary, or perhaps even sole, purpose of education is increases to industrial capacity demonstrates a pretty enormous blindspot. I've never understood why economists feel so comfortable positing industrial efficiency as an overriding societal goal as if it was just an article of faith handed down from on high. Other disciplines have to justify their evaluative metrics. Why does economics just get a pass?

An enormous proportion of the generalized absolute increase in quality of life is [likely attributable to more and better investment in human capital](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1818907?seq=3#page_scan_tab_contents). Caplan is clearly dismissive of institutional economics generally, positing that much the returns from human capital investment could likely be achieved in other ways. What he means is that most of the *industrial* benefits of education could likely be achieved in other ways. He's treating industrial throughput as an end unto itself. I think, and I'm rather sure that most non-neo-classical economists would agree with me, that this is a flawed framework. The justification for markets is that they provide, in many instances, [the most efficient possible allocation of goods](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1907467) and, in so doing, increase quality of life. To the extent that pure marketization of behavior *decreases* quality of life, I believe, and I'm pretty sure most people believe, it can and should be discarded.

In other words, there are any number of purposes to a college education *other* than developing skills that can be directly monetized in the medium to short term: exploration, growth, building social capital, citizenship and recreation. Universities exist to help people develop a marketable skillset, and I would even stipulate to the idea that they're not always as focused on that mission to the extent they should be. The idea, though, that we're *overly* invested in education as a society because we can't directly measure in income terms all the benefits or because we could conceive of alternate arrangements that taught industrial skills more efficiently -- I think it's just nuts.

There are *enormous* positive externalities associated with education. Educated people create less garbage, are associated with far less violence, are members of generally more stable communities. While I don't have direct data on this, I would guess that most people find educated people to be generally more pleasant on an interpersonal basis and would prefer to have social networks more densely packed with educated people.

Aside from the opportunity cost that public money spent on education is redirected from other possibly beneficial avenues of such as medical research or poverty amelioration (and frankly, any Libertarian making that argument is shedding crocodile tears as far as I'm concerned) there's really no such thing as too much money spent on education. There's just no real downside to it for society. Particularly as we enter into an age of increased automation where we will likely have consistent surpluses of labor, there's really worse ways to have people spend their days or even their lives than in the classroom.

"As an epistemological/ research design problem, this is very very very difficult to find out. You can interview managers of firms about the motivations for their CSR activities, but could you ever believe them? In general, you're going to have a hard time finding firms that can sustain investment without at least advancing some sort of argument that you ""do well by doing good"" if their investors are concerned about maximizing profits. On the other hand, if a company relies on socially-minded shareholders/investors willing to take sub-optimal profits in exchange for some ""social return"" generated by the company, then that's more of a niche market that the firm is responding to, and profiting off of (perhaps at the expense of actual charities that would otherwise be more direct philanthropic beneficiaries of those investors).

Or there's the wrinkle that executives may do CSR to increase their own prestige, bolster their social network, and thereby maximize their personal utility/ future income potential, rather than maximize the firm's profits. Does this count as seeking social responsibility without seeking long term profit?

"Maybe in Europe. As far as America goes, all the backlash seems to be squarely targeted on ""regressive liberalism"" and the cultural left and it's steady fall into decadency and indecency. All the right wing vitriol is leveled towards 'social justice warriors' and 'campus safe space/trigger warning culture'. I don't see any sort of real critique leveled towards capitalism from the right. Definitely from populist left, though (like Bernie's people).

"Orthodox microeconomic theory says yes...rent controls reduce the supply of rental housing. But the standard price-floor interpretation only applies to perfectly competitive markets. See the first paragraph of: Arnott, Richard. ""Time for revisionism on rent control?."" The Journal of Economic Perspectives 9, no. 1 (1995): 99-120.

In reality this depends on a lot of factors.

 Is the rent control/ price floor actually below the market clearing rent? Usually yes, otherwise it's a very ineffective policy, even for the lucky rent-controlled occupants.

Is the supply of housing otherwise limited by other factors such as building codes, zoning, restrictive covenants, etc.? In this case rent control might not be terribly important to the overall supply.

Is the housing market characterized by a largely interchangeable properties and largely interchangeable bidders? In some places, may be not. Maybe the housing market is more of a matching problem where very wealthy people with idiosyncratic tastes are looking for matches for particular kinds of houses in particular neighborhoods, over which the landlords have effective monopoly power. In this case, rent control might keep landlords from trying to extract monopoly rents from these idiosyncratic wealthy people and be more open to the general rental consumer.

Are high-income people immigrating to the city at a rate faster than new rental housing could possibly be built to such a degree that market rents would fall or equilibrate? This is essentially the argument of certain non-YIMBY (but not necessarily NIMBY) housing activists in the SF bay area.

"&gt;Elsewhere in this post is a criticism of Caplan for his overly narrow economic focus but this post opens with a statement that instantly adopts the language of classical economics.

&gt;This is only incongruous if you're an ideologue.

This is pretty smug and wildly inaccurate. Classical economics is not the default evaluative paradigm of social science. It is one of many. [Institutional economics](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/000169939203500101), [human capital theory](http://www.springerlink.com/index/D15X2810855WX085.pdf) and especially [behavioral economics](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=8_S6cOkHK3MC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=behavioral+economics+criticism+classical+economics&amp;ots=I3aSiYJv6D&amp;sig=7yn6QlQGbR7x_985zTVPToe-BeA) have been consistently critical of the narrow conceptions of the social pricing mechanism in neo-classical thought -- and that's just the criticisms that comes from *within* economics. There are genuine epistemological and methodological differences in the social sciences, and claiming that the only basis for disagreement is ideology is extremely myopic.

Caplan implies that the primary benefit of a Princeton degree is the signal it sends to its employers, not the value of the education. What he means is that the primary *classical economic* benefits is the signalling mechanism. Which is true. In addition, there are any number of other benefits on top of that beneficial to both the individual and that have second-order impacts for society in general. I'm simply trying to point out that, for the most part, the above post and Caplan's thought experiment share many of the same assumptions -- assumptions that most other social scientific disciplines would find incomplete at best.

&gt;This is not relevant unless you can demonstrate a causal link sans selection effects.

This is utter special pleading. This is social science, there's almost never a demonstrable causal link. There is no way to demonstrate an irrefutable counterfactual because most social mechanisms are not or cannot be randomly assigned. The correlational links between education and broadly positive social outcomes has been demonstrated over and over and over again. This is a sufficient empirical warrant for social action by any typical standard: we take far more action in our society with much less evidence.

&gt;Given limited resources, it is not inconceivable that there could be more cost-effective ways to enlighten the populace and prepare young people for careers than the current system.

There's a lot of things that aren't inconceivable, but the burden of proof lies with the person making the claim, not the other to prove a negative. This is essentially a manipulative logical argument that points out flaws in the current system (which no one could dispute, of course the educational system is flawed) and then implies, therefore, there must be - out there, somewhere - a better system, without actually proposing one or providing evidence it would be better.

My point is simple: classical economics, by its nature, is blind to or dismissive of, most of the primary justifications of broadly liberal education, saying that it is not the most efficient way to generate productive workers and dismissing all other concurrent purposes as unimportant or irrelevant. Thus, when we discuss education through the prism of classical economics, we are, to a pretty extraordinary extent, rigging the conversation against the present system when other social science fields would have compelling arguments in favor.",,,,rynebrandon,Public Policy,,1509048987,t5_2sml9,t3_78rhkl,t1_dowqdoz,3,1510213663,0,0,doxm4yp,AskSocialScience,,,pub

"Former philosophy teacher here. 

Philosophers don't much care for cultural relativism because 1) it's clearly the wrong moral theory and 2) many students seem to accept it as true and that's frustrating. 

But first, a distinction. There is an important distinction between descriptive theories and prescriptive theories. It's uncontroversial that different cultures do in fact have different moral views. So, in this sense, cultural relativism is true. But, philosophers don't care about that very much. What they care about is if the moral theory is true, i.e., does it accurately describe what we ought to do. And in this sense, cultural relativism is false (and morally reprehensible). 

On the prescriptive side of things, cultural relativism, the view that the right action is determined by one's culture, has major problems and because of those problems, it is rejected by philosophers. 

Problem 1: Cultural relativism is not compatible with cross-cultural comparisons. This is actually the reason many people are attracted to CR, but it's still a horrible idea. If CR is true, it becomes impossible to say that any culture is morally better than any other. Sounds nice, I guess, but that's a pretty crazy view. There are cultures that respect human rights, take care of the poor, don't murder people for being albinos, etc. And there are cultures that don't allow women to vote, punish gays with death, allow slavery, have no free press, cut the clitorises out of young girls, etc. According to CR, these cultures are all morally equivalent. And that's fucked up.

Problem 2: CR doesn't allow for cross-temporal comparisons. Which culture do you think is morally better, 1940s Germany or 2010s Germany. 1940s Germany built death camps that killed, what? 10 million people? It didn't have a free press. Mentally slow people were sterilized, it didn't have a democracy, etc. We know the story. 2010s Germany has free elections, free press, respects human rights, is trying to combat global warming, etc. According to CR, these cultures are morally equivalent. And that's fucked up.

Problem 3: CR passes the wrong judgment on people who try to change culture. Who was better: the cops who beat and arrested the peaceful protesters in 1950s America, or Martin Luther King Jr.? According to CR, it was the people trying to protect society's laws. That is, the cops were the good guys and King was the bad guy. Or, even better, according the CR, the Nazi guards at the concentration camp were the good guys and  Willi Graf was a bad guy because he tried to change his society. And that's unbelievably fucked up. 

So, in short, as a prescriptive moral theory, Cultural Relativism is fucked up and nobody should accept it. 

This doesn't mean we have to be intolerant. We can tolerate different cultures. But, we don't have to and we shouldn't tolerate immoral acts. If the Japanese like to bow instead of shaking hands, that's cool. It's morally irrelevant. But if the Saudis want to hang gays rather than accept them as humans, that's not cool. It's morally reprehensible.    

Anyway, there's lots written about this stuff, but if you want an accessible account of CR's failings, check out James Rachels' *The Elements of Moral Philosophy*. It's a short, introductory level textbook that is used in 100s of philosophy classes all over the country.

"That is interesting someone like Inglehart is making that argument. Marxists have long argued that capitalism has a natural decay and that the common proclivity to ""maintain it"" (if in a damaged form) is fascism.

Some of the modern marxist writers, such as William Robinson and others who write on ""transnational capitalist class"", argue that with globalization and neoliberalism the capacity of the state to mitigate contradictions in capitalism (keynesianism post-great depression) has declined. Thus, the ""great recession"" was a result of the unraveling of those measures, greater pressure on the state to remove those measures and not prepare for correction (instead bailouts and increases elite and corporate wealth/power), leading to elements of neo-fascism which do no corrections (continued elite/corporate empowerment) displace blame, with ostensible stability (in the form of existing caste system).

"Populism has a long history. I think it's best to think of populist attitudes as always existing but usually dormant, and occasionally circumstances are favorable to populist attitudes being thrust out in the open. In Europe, populism dates back to at least the late 19th century, and in the USA populism dates back further, with Andrew Jackson typically being seen as the first powerful populist.

Populism is more about messaging than it is actual policy, which is why populism can exist both on the left-wing (Bernie Sanders) and the right (Trump). Populism in both variants posits that the rich / elites are screwing the country over to everyone else's detriment, with the right-wing variety adding that the elites are purposefully favoring a minority to everyone's detriment as well.

As for why populism is on the rise now, I have my own pet theory, which is backed by previous recurrences of populism in the US (which I'm most familiar with). It seems to me that, roughly every 30-40 years or so, the political-economic system which had been prevailing breaks down for whatever reason, and this breakdown makes the dominant political parties seem incompetent because their policies failed to prevent the calamity. When faced with the breakdown, both parties respond in the ways which worked under the previous regime; those responses fail, and they lose public legitimacy as a result (you can see it today in the common charge that all politicians are self-serving and corrupt). This lack of legitimacy in the mainstream leads to the rise of maverick outsiders who blame the entire system (as opposed to one set of policies), who enjoy their time in the spotlight until their positions are subsumed into the mainstream of one or both major parties. Because both major parties see convergence on the same set of policies over time, when those policies fail, they're both seen as irresponsible or incapable, and that opens a window of opportunity for populists (whose ideas lie outside the mainstream of both parties) to advocate for radical change.

I'll illustrate two such paradigm shifts in US political-economic policy, starting with the Great Depression. The Republican response to the Depression under Hoover was to keep doing what had been done from ~1900 until 1929, which was laissez-faire. Their thinking, which worked fine in previous recessions, was basically to let the markets purge themselves of the speculative frenzy, and eventually the economy will right itself and be healthier for it. This didn't do much to help recovery and enabled FDR to get elected on a platform which was a radical departure from the previous norms of political-economic governance; FDR was much more in favor of Keynesian interventions (though he wouldn't have called them that) and government involvement in the economy in general.  As a side note, FDR was forced into more liberal New Deal programs because of New Orleans left-wing activist Huey Long, who advocated for universal basic income, a right to work, and other out-of-the-mainstream positions. FDR's solutions were considered heretical by the old guard, and they lobbied against FDR's programs and the New Deal as hard as they possibly could, but FDR's solutions eventually worked. Acceptance of a larger role for the state in the economy became conventional wisdom; by the 1950s, Eisenhower (a Republican) instituted a gigantic public-works project in the same scale as FDR's TVA, and LBJ (a Democrat) proposed ending poverty a few years later. Nixon (a Republican) proposed a universal childcare a few years after that; the combination of these sweeping proposals across political parties shows that there was broad acceptance of a large, active state intervening in the economy for the public good. This conventional wisdom lasted until the stagflation of the 70s, which is the subject of the next paragraph.

The stagflation of the 1970s threw the interventionist state model into question. Keynesian prescriptions no longer worked, and deficit spending grew to worrisome levels as a result of social programs and Vietnam. The economy stagnated while inflation grew to double digits by the end of the decade, and neither party really knew what to do about it. The crisis culminated in the Republican re-invention of itself as the small-government, free-trade, free-market-loving party that it is today. This proved successful in the 80s, and grew to the point that those economic policies became mainstream for Democrats as well as they copied what was successful, because these policy choices became conventional wisdom. Bill Clinton (a Democrat) helped China join the WTO, shrank welfare, and balanced the budget - all mainstream Republican positions from their 1980s re-invention. Then the crisis hit in 2008, and both sides were blamed - Republicans for blind adherence to deregulatory faith, and Democrats for continued government intervention in the economy via Fannie / Freddie - but neither of these descriptions really offer convincing explanations for how to prevent the next crisis. 

This has led to a questioning of the old conventional wisdom (shrink the government, trust the market, rising trade lifts all boats) and has led to a variety of experimental policy responses. The fact that both Hillary and Trump ran against the TPP, a major trade agreement in the Pacific, goes to show how how at least part of the old dogma (adherence to free trade) has gotten tossed out by both parties. I would expect that, by 2020 or 2024, both parties will have adopted economic policy positions that would have gotten candidates disqualified for saying in 1996.

What we're going through now is a generational shift in political-economic policy. It appears chaotic to us because we're living through it and because it's not yet settled, but there will eventually be agreement on what the conventional wisdom is going forward, and we'll have a couple of decades of success, and then it will fall apart again and the process will repeat. 

Anyway that's my theory. If you're interested in some of the books that buttress it, let me know. 

tl;dr the conventional wisdom on how economic policy should look gets periodically demolished and rebuilt, and we're going through a rebuilding phase right now. Such phases are fertile ground for populists, because their ideas lie outside the conventional wisdom, and the conventional wisdom has been de-legitimized as a result of economic conditions.",,,,albacore_futures,,,1508778724,t5_2sml9,t3_784z2t,t1_dori9xs,19,1510108400,0,0,dorzenp,AskSocialScience,,,

"Well, again, pretty much all that discuss socialism will not use it in replace of other terms.

"Regulation is a big issue to stop and even reverse climate change. For instance, Pigovian taxes are enforced by the government to stop polluters from free-ridding social welfare. (Read the economist article bellow on externalities). The government is, in theory, the institution powerful enough to stop polluters from shifting costs to society. Monitoring data is crucial due to the high statistical uncertainty of the current climate models (climate changes in decades, so constant updates and inputs are required to keep up). Solutions do emerge as a cooperation of public and private sectors. For instance, renewables are strongly supported by regulators and new firms are gaining ground.  
We as consumers need to remain aware of the challenges industries and governments face due to regulation, over regulation and under regulation. Solutions are hard to come by. There is no silver bullet to solve our climate maladies. We need to try, fail and learn from different approaches to the climate puzzle. Yes, it is a puzzle since different actors operate under their own ""logic"". Long story short, people have different interests in nature and climate, we need to preserve the well being of future generations, and take a stance for policies that protect us and our children.

"Recently became very curious about the climate message and religion. I believe that climate is being preached to people by scientists in hopes to create a dooms day vision. Maybe not intentionally, but the media certainly fills in the gaps. Every religion needs an apocalypse, and the apocalypse of science is climate change. Certainly, the threat is significant but not real. Pretty much like the Damocles sword, it will fall, but we cannot tell when. Since we miss the when, we miss the fact of climate change. On the other hand this might be good for the climate. People tend to be swayed more by emotion (fear) than by argument. So we might change policy (by the wrong reasons) but with positive outcomes nevertheless. However, I doubt that fear policy cannot remain stable for long. People are talking about one-child policies and so on. No talk about environmental justice.",,,,Galileotierraplana,,,1508520567,t5_2sml9,t3_77ma9e,t3_77ma9e,3,1510020582,0,0,don9awd,AskSocialScience,,,

"I see. Thanks for your constructive response. I will try again to refine my question. Its a messy idea as of now, but I'd like to understand why progress in our society does not go towards strengthening communities and relationships. Instead, it tends to break them apart and makes these connections more fragile. I agree that my prior examples were not very well-thought out. I do think that extended family living is a good example, but that is an example that used to exist and then later this became less common, in spite of more and larger housing options.


I know a bit of this idea is covered in Bowling Alone (but I have not read it yet). I'm not convinced my idea is true. I'd just like to find information to either refute it or approve of it",,,,Wearyandwhiny,,,1508525584,t5_2sml9,t3_77jiys,t1_don0w4h,2,1510023025,0,0,done2uc,AskSocialScience,,,

"The need for regulation, for instance environmental regulation will exist for at least as long as there are externalities that agents in the economy would not take into account in their decision making otherwise. At a global level, environmental regulation and environmental treaties face a multitude of issues related to participation and free-riding. Economics, especially game theory and mechanism design step in to provide some solutions to these problems, and to give us an idea as to what degree they can be corrected with designing proper contracts and so forth.

Yeah I get the need for regulation. I guess what i'm trying to say is that the narrative within the scientific community is to tell the public/government stuff that we already know (i.e. The situation is bad) followed by what is essentially fluff to anyone who is not actively employed in that field (i.e. Hurricanes increased by x%). It's like paying a mechanic to tell you what's wrong with your car every year and not demanding that he fix it. Not saying it's easy but if they don't do it then who will? I guess its just a testament to how ineffective bureaucracies are. Thanks for your input.,,,,Atriox998,,,1508538265,t5_2sml9,t3_77n231,t1_donnamb,1,1510028994,0,0,donp4z6,AskSocialScience,,,

"Happy to talk it over! You have some interesting points here, and the kernel of a great question.

One problem I still have is that you’re still assuming that progress really does break communities and relationships apart. I’m not sure that it does, because what it means to have a strong relationship can change over time.

Maybe a more appropriate question is how does social and technological progress affect our social fabric? (Or something like that)

This isn’t my field at all, but I’m going to look over that article you mentioned, and see if I can find any low hanging fruit for you to think about.",,,,just_works_here,Public and International Affairs,,1508539561,t5_2sml9,t3_77jiys,t1_done2uc,1,1510029545,0,0,donq478,AskSocialScience,,,polisci
