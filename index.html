        		<h1>Robert M. Bond</h1>
				<p>I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Communication at Ohio State University. I received a Ph.D. in political science from the University of California, San Diego in 2013. I also studied at Arizona State University, where I graduated with an M.A. in political science in 2007 and a B.A. in political science in 2006. My core research interest is in political behavior and attitudes, specifically how our social networks influence our political behavior and communication. I use computational methods to understand why people behave as they do, how they communicate, and what the effects of communication are for politics.  Much of this core area of research uses big data to study social influence on political behaviors and attitudes, including large-scale field experiments on turnout, and observational work on ideology. In addition to my main areas of work, I have studied the development of political attitudes and behaviors in the social networks of adolescents, social network effects on aggression, and social attitudes about prejudice, using social network techniques. Below you will find links to my published work, working papers, and my coauthors' webpages. For more detailed information about my professional background please see my CV and here is a link to my Google Scholar profile.</a></p>
